0,Terrific Stay in a GRAND hotel!,5,8,2020,rivieramayaguy,"We spent 3 nights at the beautiful Gran Hotel Ciudad de Mexico,  This is one of the most beautiful places at which we've ever stayed.  The public spaces are truly grand especially the stain glass ceiling.   The rooms were well appointed, beds comfortable and the Terrace Restaurant offered a terrific view of Zocalo Square. But the best part was the staff.. from check-in to check-out our experience was wonderful.  We had a slight issue with the room air conditioning and could not have been more pleased with the fast, professional response.  Truly a first class hotel!  We were especially pleased with staff members Cynthia at the Front Desk, Bellman Victor and Doorman/Bellman Jose Luis.  They remembered our names and addressed us each time we entered and truly provided great personal and professional service. We hope to be back soon!…","Responded Aug 17, 2020","Response from Gerente General, Otro at Gran Hotel Ciudad De MexicoResponded Aug 17, 2020","Dear guest,   Thanks for sending your comment.

6,"Not as expected, outdated rooms!!",3,5,2022,Ahmed K,"Been there for 4 nights with my wife.  The hotel’s location is in the center, very close to restaurants, shops and bars.  The room didn’t give me the feeling of a 5 star hotel. Very outdated with a broken shower and a very bad smell during my whole stay.  It was very noisy as my room was direct on Zocalo square. I was offered an upgrade but it was after my 2nd night so it would’ve been too much of a hassle to change rooms.  In general, the staff were friendly.  Definitely i will try another hotel in my next trip to Mexico city.",Responded 2 weeks ago,"Response from Gerente General, Otro at Gran Hotel Ciudad De MexicoResponded 2 weeks ago","Dear Ahmed, Thank you for taking the time for having provided us with your opinion. We really regret that your expectations were not fulfilled this time, as our mission is making our guests happy by creating unique experiences. As you have noticed, the hotel as well as the rooms maintain a classical and vintage style in order to perfectly match with the design the building originally counts with. Regarding the aspects mentioned, we will verify these immediately and give the necessary corrections.        If you give us a second opportunity, you can select one of our internal rooms, as these are an excellent option if you want a silent and peaceful rest.  Once again, we offer a sincere apologize and we hope that you can give us a second opportunity in the future.  Sincerely,"

9,The model all hotels should follow!,5,5,2022,MarkyP30,"If I were designing the perfect hotel I would model it on the Mexico City Sofitel Reforma. The building, view, food and location are perfect but the true differentiator is their staff!  They really do go above and beyond to make your stay perfect and ensure you feel at home. This is particularly important when travelling!  José Manuel Delgado and his team (Fernanda, Jonathan, Gisela) helped me whenever I needed with paperwork, questions, bookings and treated me with kindness and care. They are a credit to Sofitel!

10,Luxury 40th birthday celebration in Mexico City,5,5,2022,dannnie82,"My husband and I spent 5 days in Mexico City to celebrate his 40th birthday. We have been to Tulum, Cancun, Cozumel and Playa( you know all of the resort towns) and were looking for a different experience. So we settled on Mexico City. Not too far away, fun, vibrant, diverse and bursting at the seems with culture and flare. If you are looking for something different, Mexico City is definitely a place to go.  But enough about the town, this review is for the hotel.  We stayed at the Sofitel Mexico City Reforma and it did not disappoint. We have stayed at many luxury hotels in many different cities and this one was second to none.  It started off about 2 weeks prior to our stay when the staff reached out to see if they could help us plan our trip. They sent me an offering of ideas to decorate the room for my husband upon our arrival, booked our airport transportation, booked a Hot Air Balloon Ride, A full day trip to Xochimilco complete with a tour guide and not to mention got us reservations at some of the hottest restaurants in Mexico City that had told us they were booked.  From our first day Marla, Luis, Arturo and  Ricardo went out of their way to make our stay amazing.  Ricardo gave us an amazing Tequila tasting right there in the lobby bar and provided so much information about the tequila and the region. He and Marla even sent us home with drink recipes to try at home!   Arturo came through with the dinner reservations every day and the private tour with Roberto, which was amazing. With Roberto, we were able to explore Xochimilco like locals. We visited a local market and ate with the locals, rode a Coyoacán and visited the Frida Kahlo Museum.  We booked through AMEX fine hotels which provided us with some additional amenities that made the experience even better.  Sofitel Mexico City Reforma is a must when in Mexico city, I'd give it a 10 out 10!!!…",Responded 1 week ago,"Response from Jose Delgado, Guest Services / Front Office at Sofitel México City ReformaResponded 1 week ago","Bonjour dannnie82,  What a joy to read that you had a wonderful birthday celebration with us!

14,Great Stay just be careful with the hidden charges on Airport Shuttle.,4,5,2022,Twc3011,The hotel is very nice great service great facilities and service. (It was annoying on morning going to the lobby and half of the staff were in protest due to Corporate Greed the owners not giving the staff bonuses.) But our stay was great with a very nice breakfast each morning and everyone was nice. We were told that they have a shuttle  from the hotel to the airport we booked it no one mentioned a price. Once arriving at the airport the shuttle bus driver told us it would be $25.00 or 500 pesos. We paid it but wish they would have told us earlier we would have taken Uber for much cheaper.,Responded 1 week ago,"Response from Gabriela Gonzalez, Other at Galeria Plaza ReformaResponded 1 week ago","Dear guest, we highly appreciate all feedback as it is the only way to measure our performance and improve our processes.

19,Definitely not fives!,3,5,2022,Jared,"This is a very old upscale hotel near Mexico City centro, that by the looks of it I'm guessing was built in the 19th century. It is still in really good condition, particularly in the lobby which with a well dressed staff presents the image of a five star hotel, but the rooms are a different story. They very small and have comfortable beds but the  wood work is coming apart and the rooms are in need of repair or renovation. Also, I witnessed a staff member ordering a guest to follow its rules. Apparently, some of the hotel staff members are unaware (or don't care) that the only reason they have a job, and the only reason hotel remains in business - is because of its paying customers.  This kind of upside down thinking and behavior in businesses seems to be increasing. I guess many have abandoned or forgotten ""the customer is king"" philosophy. Sadly, real customer service seems to be fading into oblivion, and is being replaced by little power hungry self appointed would be tyrants. Sign of the times we've entered into now I guess, monkey see - monkey do.…",Responded 3 weeks ago,"Response from Asistente Direccion, Atención al huésped/Recepción at Emporio ReformaResponded 3 weeks ago","Dear Mr. Jared,   Thank you very much for your time dedicated to share your experience, we appreciate your feedback and the Maintenance Manager is taking care of the situation immediately, please be sure that your comments will be transmitted to the different department to work on them immediately.

20,"Good location, okay stay only",2,4,2022,Anel Z,The hotel itself is plain okay. The staff put too much passion on covid restrictions and forgot that their main business is hospitality. They took about 40 mins to bring the drinks. The process to check in is long.

34,Stay at hotel catedral,5,4,2022,Laura,"My husband and I just got back from our trip to Mexico city. We chose hotel cathedral for it's location and great reviews. Although the building might need some updating due to it's age, the customer service is incredible. Thelma, Alan, Nancy and Miguel were extremely attentive and made our experience great. The daily included breakfast was phenomenal. I especially appreciated Thelma's attentiveness and her daily food recommendations. She is a gem. The location in the historic city center provided us with so many options of places to visit. It's a block from the cathedral, 1/2 a block from the temple mayor, and it's surrounded by great restaurants, coffee shops, book stores, and anything else you might need. Bella's Arte's is within walking distance and it's a very pleasant stroll to get there. At no point did I feel unsafe. Overall I would highly recommend staying at the hotel cathedral. Also the complimentary refrigerated water battles are a nice touch.…","Responded Apr 18, 2022","Response from Hotel Catedral, Director General at Hotel CatedralResponded Apr 18, 2022","Estimated Goyosmon Thank you very much for your kind comment and for taking and taking the time to comment, it is a pleasure to have met your expectations and we will pass the comment on to our buffet companions since your comment is very important to us, we hope to see you soon"
35,Best Hotel in the Historic Center,5,6,2022,Lei,"We’ve stayed in this hotel in 3 separate occasions and are always very impressed with the offering.  The price is right for the cleanliness, location, security and design.  We actually booked a different hotel just to try something different and upon arrival learned they wouldn’t have electricity until night time, the security and service left a lot to be desired.  Thankfully, we were able to cancel and booked a Jr. suite that saved our trip.  Thanks to Fernando who made our checkin a breeze and went above and beyond to accommodate us.  We were greeted with top shelf tequila and had the best view of el Zocalo.  We’ve also stayed in the more economical rooms which are great if you’re not planning on spending much time in your  room, they tend to be small but well equipped, clean and comfortable .  The breakfast is the BEST in town and is included in your stay as well as unlimited bottled water, beers, soft drinks, sandwiches, chips… in short you get your money’s worth.  We won’t make the mistake of booking elsewhere on our next visit.

41,The perfect place to stay in Mexico City,5,4,2022,Pat S,"One of my favourite hotels during our two week trip. The location can not be beaten-right on the corner of the central square with superb views from the rooftop bar and restaurant. The room was clean and comfortable and the staff so helpful. What impressed me most was the thought that had gone into what their guest might want-there were fridges on every floor with bottled water (especially welcome as it is not wise to use tap water even for brushing teeth) and then there was the 24 hour café in the lobby. We weren't really listening when we checked in and thought we could get  complimentary tea, coffee and beer (even that was impressive!!), We used it twice for tasty snacks after two busy days of sightseeing and discovered when we came to settle our bill they were complimentary too. It came in very handy when we had to leave for an early flight before the restaurant had opened for breakfast.

42,Like a Great Cruise Ship,5,4,2022,Dubaigateways,"In April of 2022, I had the pleasurable good fortune to be a guest at Zocalo Central for five days. In a factual manner, the hotel is quite fabulous on a number of fronts. The location is stunning, the restaurant is superb, cleanliness is excellent, and the guest rooms reflect the classy style that is evident not only in the lobby but beyond.  These factors alone would merit a better than good review. But it is the staff that really lifted the experience to make it quite exceptional. All of them; from the front desk to the housekeeping personnel. Particularly on the roof top restaurant (Balcon del Zocalo) where Samara was an attentive and most capable hostess - an excellent ambassador for the property. Down in the Cafe, Joshua was interested in guests beyond them being mere clients.  I have worked as an international airline pilot for my entire career, and as such have seen countless countless hotels, hotel rooms and their attendant staff.

The cafe at the ground floor is open 24 hours and serves great snacks and coffee. This really helped when we got hungry in the middle of the night. It was awesome that everything with the exception of alcoholic beverages were complimentary.   The room was not so spacious but was fine as we did not stay in the room most of the day. The room and bathroom was very clean. No complaints whatsoever with the room and staff.   The breakfast at the top floor was superb! I really enjoyed the food.

60,"Old, but still a good option.",4,4,2022,Jerome Patrick L,"I feel I should be careful how I word this review as I stay at this hotel very often and get an excellent crew rate. First the good. This is probably the most conveniently located hotel at terminal 1 and the closest to the national departure gates. It has it’s own valet parking and is adjacent to one of the airport car parks for those of us who feel uncomfortable handing our car key to a complete stranger. There are three excellent private restaurants within the hotel and the hotel’s own restaurant serves a really good breakfast and lunch buffet. The gym is well equipped and has a spa. Everything is clean and the service is excellent, especially at the front desk where the well trained staff are polite and very efficient. Now the bad. This is a very old hotel and some of the rooms are noisy. I’ve been staying here so long I know which ones to avoid. Most are okay but some are really noisy to the point where you can hear your neighbors chatting in conversational tones.  At the moment some of the floors are being remodeled and rooms that are far too close to the constant hammering and drilling are still being used. I was given one at the beginning of my latest stay here but, thankfully, the good people at the front desk were very quick to find me a quieter room when I complained.

63,Good stay but poor sleep,4,1,2022,Sally M,"Negatives  1. I could not sleep the whole night despite being on a high floor. The reason being continuous noise from street; that is, of the sermaphore and of various police cars or ambulances passing by. The windows are old type and not made to isolate such noise. Further, the fire detector sensor inside the room, kept blinking the whole night, on my face.  For this reason alone, I will never return in this hotel.  Positives :-  1. Great front desk. very efficient. Contactless check in.  2. Nice room. Nice bed.  3. Excellent shower. very good water pressure and very hot water. Both a rarity in Mexico City.  4. Starbocks right inside the hotel ( or almost).  5. They gave me complimentary wine bottle ( 33 cl) and some pastries in night ; though I stayed only 1 night! Really touched by the gesture.  6. Good internet.  7. Very safe and central location. Lot of security.  8. Nice restaurant - Distral on location.  9. Complimentary late check out offered.  10. Great value for money.  If you can sleep with street noise, you may stay here.  If noise was not an issue, I would stay in this hotel for ever but I checked out in 1 night.

Its right in the center of a busy section and there were constant noises of police sirens, what sounded like gun shots, car horns and protests every day that I was there which was frightening for a female on her own.

It is a 5 star hotel, but an old one.  The staff though, makes it all worthwhile.  They really try to please you and solve your problems... that is, as much as the old infrastructure allows them to.  I had to ask for room changes on more than one occasion.  The A/C never reaches your desired temperature.  Some bathrooms have issues like clogged drainages, poor water pressure, etc.  Wifi is free, but less than optimal, and rooms on certain floors have little to none internet access.  The location is amazing, and it compensates for most of their flaws.  Pricewise, they are cheap compared to some hotels in the same range, and in the same area.

74,Perfect Stay in CDMX - One of the Best Hilton Properties Around,5,6,2022,Andrew C,"I recently stayed 6 nights at the Hilton Reforma, and was my second time at the property - as a frequent Hilton customer (Hilton Diamond member), I cannot overstate  how well this property is managed and maintained.    The levels of service (especially in the Executive Lounge) is extremely high and my family and I enjoyed every day we stayed there.  If you can upgrade your room to an Executive floor room it is worth it - they have a great happy hour and breakfast every day.  Also, if you are going to CDMX for pleasure, this is a great location as the historic Zocalo is right down the street.  Stefany and Lionel in the Executive Lounge (and the rest of the lounge staff) made sure that my family was comfortable and taken care of.  Nayeli and Jaime with the Concierge team will be able to point you in the right direction of what's going on in CDMX.

Located centrally in the historic center, we walked to all the sights and took an Uber to other neighborhoods further away. What made our stay special to us was the excellent Executive Floor Hilton team. Jazmin L and Estephany R were wonderful hostesses were attentive, competent and always ready to help.

79,Review of Spa Only,2,5,2022,banananut,This review is of the spa only. I wanted to do a relaxing day while in CDMX and asked our hotel for recommendations of spa that has outdoor pool. The prices were high but I booked anyway thinking it would be a luxury day. Wrong!! I went early to use their gym. Decent gym and our hotel has no weights so was looking forward to it. My and my husbands appointment started at 1. I made sure to be ready by then. But I waited and waited - no one in spa and you can’t go out cause it is gym and now I’m only in a robe. Finally at 1:37 they come to get me and said they were looking for me in the gym and her coworker said I was t there. This could not be true as I sat there the whole time and the gym is just one large room with maybe 3 people in it. My massage was only 30 min so missing 7 is a lot. Then i was told no it was at 1:30 that I was supposed to on my own use jacuzzi for half an hour first..well why didnt they tell me? Then went to my nail appointment late but she was kind and did a good job. Afterwards what I was most looking forward to laying by the pool. My husband was already there cause apparently they came and got him 15 minutes early?? The pool chairs were in terrible condition and uncomfortable. We tried ordering a couple drinks and food. The first two wines they did not have and our food came out wrong. So we cut our losses and left. If you are wanting a massage while on vacation look elsewhere. You can find much cheaper almost anywhere I was hoping we were paying for all day pampering but no.…,Responded 3 weeks ago,"Response from GM Reforma, Guest Services / Front Office at Hilton Mexico City ReformaResponded 3 weeks ago","Dear banananut, Thank you so much for your recent visit to Hilton Mexico City Reforma and for the time sharing your review through TripAdvisor.

Great bed, great water pressure, great internet. Beautiful building.  2. Drop off to airport available  Negatives  1. Untrained front desk. There was a woman called , Cassandra at duty at 0230 am. She had no self identification and seemed dressed as if she was at home. At 0300 in morning, she took 20 minutes to check me in. As she claimed her printer was not working.  2. Its almost impossible to arrive at hotel even with gps. There is no signboards anywhere in airport stating direction of hotel. I got lost many times after arriving at domestic airport to reach this hotel. I suggest to take a taxi! Especially of you have luggage or are too tired.  3.

Only egg or fruit or pancake. further, i must go to restaurant to take the food. There is no service to leave my food packet at front desk. I was very disappointed.

85,Good night's sleep,5,4,2022,Chris K,"I stayed here for 1 night on business. The hotel is located across from Terminal 1 but finding it can be a hassle, especially if you are carrying luggage and speak limited Spanish. Within Terminal 1, find GATE 7 and take the escalator upstairs to LEVEL 1.  From there, walk across the airbridge and you should find it. I didn’t do my research beforehand, assuming there would be signs or I could ask staff, but there weren’t any signs that I saw and some of the staff I had asked in Spanish didn’t have a clue.  The hotel itself is clean and quiet.  They provided water and a beer upon check-in.   WIFI was reliable.  There’s a hotel that had decent tacos and quesadillas and a full bar.  The gym was nice and spacious, with dumbbells up to 50# and a pull up bar.  Plenty of treadmills, and they provided large water bottles there.  At one point, my room had a blackout as did I think the whole 3rd floor.  But after 5 minutes, power was restored and there weren’t any issues after that.  TIP:  Instead of buying water, just head into the gym and grab a few from there. TIP #2:  The room does provide 2 large water bottles already though.  I paid about $150 USD for 1 night, so not really cheap, but it is conveniently located and I had a good night’s sleep.…","Responded May 2, 2022","Response from fernanda Colin, Otro at Courtyard by Marriott Mexico City AirportResponded May 2, 2022","Dear Toyo K  Thank you for taking the time for evaluating to Courtyard Mexico City Airport.

I did the check-in on my app and although they offer Mobile Key, you still need to physically show up and wait to be checked in at the front desk. They have my credit card details, they have my preferences..why can they not send you the mobile key so that when you arrive, you simply can go to your room? I don’t get it. After waiting a bit more than 6 minutes for a clerk to come out to serve me, I got my key to a very standard room with connecting door to another room, which I have clearly defined in my profile that I do not wish for. No upgrades this time. The room was old and in dire need of renovation. The bed definitely needs a new mattress. (room 350). I then used the app to chat with the front desk. My 1st reply came an hour later. I went to the gym to use the treadmill in the morning and I was surprised that there was nothing to use to clean or disinfect the equipment. I gave 2 stars because the water pressure in the shower was really good, too bad that my bath towel was so old, that one could probably see through it. Maybe most do not mind staying there for one night, but I think for the Brand of Marriott, it’s not acceptable.…","Responded Mar 29, 2022","Response from fernanda Colin, Otro at Courtyard by Marriott Mexico City AirportResponded Mar 29, 2022","Dear Mr. Daniel,  Thank you for taking the time to let us know about your experience while staying with us.

Some employees lie and the hotel will not do anything about it.  During checking I required a “voucher” be taken from my credit card to enable me to simply sign for extras.  I did that for dinner and the waiter returned saying my account was “closed “ and I had to pay cash for the expenses. I went to the reception and verified the waiter was not telling the truth but simply requesting a cash payment to receive an extra tip (not given because of poor service ).

106,Made My Life A Little Easier During A Stressful Time...,5,4,2021,Matthew,"The Krystal Grand was my first stop on my move to Mexico City. As anyone who’s done it will tell you, moving to a place is worlds apart from vacationing there, and my two weeks at Krystal Grand consisted largely of dealing with the logistics of, and problems with, my international move.  Basically, I was stressed out most of my time there, but that wasn’t the hotel’s fault. Rather, the staff did everything they could to make my stay as pleasant as possible. The housekeeping staff did a great job, and happily worked around my unusual schedule. And the front desk and bell staff were friendly and helpful.  At the front desk, Luis Carrillo deserves special mention. Not only did he address me by name after only one meeting, he helped me numerous times when I had to have documents printed, scanned, and the like. And I needed that help quite a bit; one document required four revisions before it was accepted. Luis took care of matters every time, quick and easy.   As to the room itself, well, it’s nice. Comfortable bed, plenty of water pressure in the shower, and the public areas—those that were open during these days of COVID—were clean and pleasant. One room highlight was the climate control system. In most hotels I’ve stayed in, the in-room climate control system is something of a gamble; set a temperature and it’ll get you somewhere near comfortable...maybe. Not so the Krystal. Their in-room climate control works fast and flawlessly. No matter how you like the temperature of your room, you can dial it in and get it. Awesome.  For me the Krystal was a great stay. It’s well removed from the centro, so it may not be the best location for tourist stuff. But if you need a place on the south side, this is a great choice.…","Responded Apr 26, 2021","Response from Paloma Vega, Guest Services / Front Office at Krystal Grand Suites InsurgentesResponded Apr 26, 2021","Good afternoon Dear guest, We really appreciate your comments, your feedback is very important to us, we like to know that our staff give you the best service as you deserve it.

We arrived on a flight from London in the evening and had a connection to another part of Mexico early the next morning so needed a hotel overnight (around eight hours).  The hotel was very close to the airport.  Staff were fine but not really friendly or helpful.  The hotel was depressing and lacked atmosphere.  Rooms were basic but very dark.  Small bathroom.  There was nothing around the hotel and it was very seedy.  We wanted to walk to a supermarket across the road whereby you needed to go through a small park or something but it looked isolated and unsafe (this was still early evening but it was dark).

It was a great place to relax after a long bus ride. However there are some improvements I wish the hotel had that are common (at least common for hotels in USA.) I wish it had a microwave and a mini fridge. Also the shower took way too long to heat up giving you unreliable water temperatures when you took a 10 minute shower. It was also an open shower concept which I hated because all the warm steam, that was already limited from the sporadic water temperatures, escaped making for a cold shower experience. Check in was a breeze. Bring cash with you since they can’t accept card at times from, what my guess, is politics. Sometimes they can accept visa/Mastercard, other days they can’t. Close to the airport, it cost 132 pesos for us taking an authorized cab. The four stars is mainly for the shower experience. Service from the front desk and the employees was awesome.

113,"DISAPPOINTING, WASTE OF MONEY",1,10,2021,Timea P,"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT...MX AEROPUERTO The hotel concept and location is good, but everything else was just horrible. We have booked a month ago a room for basically a few hours, as we arrived to Mexico City at 6am and our flight was at 8pm, for this reason I have called the hotel DIRECTLY before booking it and they were kind and supportive to accommodate our request of early check in and same day check out, Mr Joel assured us there is no extra cost we can check in at 7am no issue, we just need to check out by 2pm. We arrived to the hotel, the extra cost was added on our bill, even if I explained they did not care.  But then after the check in we got truly truly disappointed we have payed around 130 dollars to stay for about 6 hours...the room was not cleaned properly, the floor was full of dust bunnies, the walls were dirty and overall very poor maintenance. We went to get breakfast, there were 2 choices on the breakfast menu: Scrambled eggs from the PREVIOUS DAY and Chilaquiles that looked really horrible, the fruits were also off, not fresh...we ended up eating a piece of toast with jam and coffee... When we got to the dining area, even if hough the waiter/chef (we don't know) was kind with us, we already got feedback from guests who were already there complaining that the food is not fresh and tastes horrible. The waiter/chef hearing the guests telling us this turned from very kind to very rude and told them off "" yes i already notified the guests, no need to keep talking about this"".  I asked if it is possible to make fresh scrambled eggs ( there were a total of 10 guests in the dining area)...we were told they will not be making fresh eggs, these are the options. After the lousy breakfast that left me hungry, we walked down the street to a small shop and got some food so I can actually eat something before going to bed. While we were sleeping the cleaners without knocking of checking with reception they just opened the door and disturbed our sleep. There is nothing more disgusting than a dirty, poor maintenance with food that is leftover from the day before and staff that is absolutely careless. Mistakes happen, people do understand that...but when the staff is completely oblivious...well that is a huge red flag.

119,Best in Mexico City,5,5,2022,Father0f6,"My wife and I stayed at the Sheraton Mexico City Maria Isabel Hotel for 5 days.  I am Marriott titanium and we used our suite nights for this stay.  About a week before we arrived we got an email that we were upgraded to a corner suite on the 17th floor with a view of Reforma and the Angle of Liberty.    When we arrived at the hotel the porter quickly grabbed our bags and check in was very quick.  The front desk staff was fluent in Spanish and English and we were in our room just a few minutes after arriving.  Note:  We could never get the mobile phone Key to work so we got a normal key card to open our suite.  The suite was great.  It had 2 rooms and both rooms had an amazing view.  Everything was very clean and the bed was great.  Also they came in and cleaned the room every day.  We had 2 bathrooms  and that was really nice too.  The club lounge is on the 18th floor and we used that every day for breakfast and also the snacks before dinner.  The food was perfect with a very good selection.  They did all the serving.  Not buffet style.  They also brought you any drinks (Pop, water, juice) you wanted.  Normally there is a little fridge to go and get your drinks but not here.  We would ask for a couple water bottles when we were leaving to get us started on our day and that was not a problem.  We used the gym and the equipment was all good.  The Pool is on the roof and it was small.  We did not use it but there were some families up there when we went to look.  The staff was great, no matter if it was the maids, club staff, front desk staff.  They were all great.  There is a Marriott across the street but it was much smaller and didn't have much of a view.  I almost stayed there but chose the Sheraton because I saw other reviews that said they recognized bonvoy status and freely gave upgrades.    I really don't have anything bad to say about the Sheraton Mexico city.  It was all good.…",Responded 2 weeks ago,"Response from Joseluis Rios, Otro at Sheraton Mexico City Maria Isabel HotelResponded 2 weeks ago","Dear Father0f6  First of all, we want to thank you for your loyalty, for being a Titanium member of our Marriott Bonvoy program, the largest in the world.

123,Review of the wheelchair accessible room.,3,5,2022,RollinRob,"This is a review for the wheelchair accessible room. I am a paraplegic and use a wheelchair. The hotel is in great location, you can roll to restaurants and bars and it’s pretty central to all the attractions. The hotel was built in the 1960’s so it’s been modified for it accessibility. They built a couple ramps at the entrance to get in. The bar in the hotel has a step to get in. Nice  4 foot wide door to get into the room. The room was a little cramped, you can get around but you can’t turn around so you need to back your way out with the wheelchair. You cant reach the thermostat it’s in the back corner behind a chair high on the wall. The bathroom is very large with pretty of room. There is a full length mirror in the room. I was disappoint that the roll in shower did not have a pull down bench. The front desk sent up a wobbly small shower chair which is very precarious to use. Most hotels at this level have a nice pull down bench on the wall. Staff was very nice. I would stay here again but wish they would upgrade the accessibility of the room a bit.…",Responded 4 weeks ago,"Response from Joseluis Rios, Otro at Sheraton Mexico City Maria Isabel HotelResponded 4 weeks ago","Dear RollinRob  Thank you for sharing with us your comments related you experience at our hotel.

124,Very disappointed,2,4,2022,Jennifer M,I was quite disappointed with my stay; first my air conditioner did not work; but perhaps more importantly I was placed in a room on the 6th floor that had the music from the disco blaring till 1 am. When I called the reception I was told they could not do anything about this. Why would someone be placed in a room where they knew it was so loud you could not sleep?  I just don't get it.

And a quick 25 minute beautiful walk down to park into the actual Central Park of their I don’t know the name of it you can look it up but it’s beautiful to see the castle. I highly recommend this hotel not only for the location but also the breakfast buffet was beautiful with delicious cappuccinos in it American coffee.

131,Good hotel stay,4,4,2022,George S,"I recently spent six nights at the Barcelo Reforma staying  on the Premium Floors. I found it to be a very good hotel, modern, efficient and inviting for guests. It is also well situated for tourists visiting the Historical Center - the Zocalo is a 20 minute walk. The Premium floors are 12 and 14 and my room was very spacious ,but spartan (only one lounge chair), with wooden floors (no carpeting) , coffee maker and a small fridge.  It was a bit dark and one could hear the folks in the adjoining room. The bathroom was fine but it had a large window with no curtains facing Reforma which had a direct view of the shower — this was weird.  The room was immaculately cleaned every day.  Food is no problem here — a steak house, and Italian and Japanese restaurants are in the hotel. There is also the Garibaldi Cafe which serves great tacos at decent prices. The front desk was pleasant and had adequate money to change Pesos. There are also a couple of tourist offices on the Lower Level which I used for day trips. There was a Covid testing facility in-house. I did not use the gym, the pool nor the spa. Generally I was impressed by the hotel and its operations.  The one minus that I noticed was the Premium Floor lounge which served complimentary breakfast in the morning and happy hour in the evening.  The breakfast was fine, but the happy hour only lasted an hour, served only Corona beer and the same inexpensive red or white wine every day.  Also the finger foods were not that good. Sadly, this Premium Floor was not comparable to the Premium Floors in the US or Europe of other major hotel chains.  That notwithstanding, I would still highly recommend this hotel to any traveler staying in CDMX.…","Responded Apr 18, 2022","Response from Ivonne  Sánchez, Propietario at Barceló México ReformaResponded Apr 18, 2022","Dear guest, we thank you in advance for your preference for the Barceló México Reforma hotel.

Unlike our reservation, we asked it again and she refused to change the room. - The room was very ugly and dark with a door which was not opened. - There was no conditioner in the bathroom and the quality of shampoo was very very low. - The rooms were not insulated and we could hear all sounds from the outside.","Responded Mar 23, 2022","Response from Ivonne  Sánchez, Propietario at Barceló México ReformaResponded Mar 23, 2022","Although we sincerely regret reading that your stay at ourBarceló México Reforma  fell short of your expectations, we are grateful for the time you spent to share this feedback of your overall holiday experience among us as we certainly believe that there is always room for improvement and your constructive feedback is very much appreciated.

The room was okay with a ""vintage"" look, but very noisy. The bottom of the door about 1.5 high from the floor so any noise from hallway could easily go through. The windows glass so thin that all the noise from neighboring places got in. Right next  door there is a night club and you could hear the music. Across from Reforma they had an ""open air dance ball"" and I could hear it from my room. The worst was the smell in the room (drain). I had to go to a near by supermarket to buy a air freshener. I got ill during my trip and felt to bad that I did not want to discuss with the staff about my accommodations. Staff was friendly, they have no control about the location or the facility. It is not well designed, even when it has been remodeled.…","Responded Feb 23, 2022","Response from Jorge  Rodriguez Argemi, Otro at Hotel Fontan ReformaResponded Feb 23, 2022","Estimado huesped (795flaviov) Es una gran consternación para nosotros leer su experiencia y definitivamente estamos puntualizando cada una de sus recomendaciones para trabajar incansablemente en recuperar su confianza.

142,Don't Go There!,2,10,2021,Alan G.,"This hotel is located on a very busy, and loud, broad avenue. If you have a room facing the avenue, it will be noisy and bright (see photo). Please see my photo showing how bright the room is, even at night with all lights turned off and ""blackout"" curtains. The main cause of that is a huge TV screen billboard right across the street that is on all night. Other issues: 1) no, there was no bottled water provided, as stated; there was only a jug in the lobby (see photo); 2) the room was large (Deluxe King room) but, even though it was said to have a ""seating area,"" it had only the area, but no seating! (See photo) Our friends had the same room on a different floor and had a large chair but we had none; 3) the bathroom was ridiculously small and cramped (see photo), the tub was tall and difficult to get into and out of, with no way to get in without sticking your head right under the shower head, and sometimes it took several minutes for hot water to reach our (6th floor) room; 4) the furnishings were old and shabby, with chipped paint (see photo); 5) breakfast upstairs was lousy; I didn't even know I could get a capuccino because there were no menus, no signage, and no one offered me one (I finally noticed the machine and asked). To top it all off, we booked through Booking.com and paid more than double what our friends paid for the same room, but the hotel couldn't do anything about it since it wasn't booked directly, and of course, you can't contact anyone at Booking.com. Never using them again! The staff is friendly but often seemed quite inept. For only a little more, you can stay at a truly luxurious hotel in CDMX. I advise everyone to avoid this hotel!…","Responded Nov 24, 2021","Response from Jorge  Rodriguez Argemi, Otro at Hotel Fontan ReformaResponded Nov 24, 2021","Apreciable (AG2130). Agradecemos de antemano el tiempo que tomo para compartir cada detalle de su experiencia con nosotros, lamentamos todos los inconvenientes por los que paso durante su visita al hotel. Como bien lo menciona estamos ubicado sobre una gran avenida, Paseo de la Reforma es una de las avenidas mas importantes y emblemáticas de la CDMX, llena de historia, entretenimiento, cultura y empresas, etc. por lo cual el movimiento sobre la misma es casi  a toda hora. en cuanto a la pantalla que usted menciona pertenece a uno de los periódicos mas importantes del país y desafortunadamente ante esto no podemos hacer nada para retirarlo. Ademas somos un grupo hotelero sustentable, preocupados por el medio ambiente, donde practicamos varias acciones para aportar nuestro pequeño grano de arena para mejoras de nuestro entorno y comunidad por lo tanto en nuestras habitaciones no se encontraran botellas de plástico con agua. En los pasillos de cada piso se encuentran contenedores con agua purificada y debidamente limpios para que nuestros huéspedes puedan tomar toda la que requieran. Reconocemos que podemos tener muchas fallas, pues después de muchos meses de permanecer cerrados por el tema de pandemia reconocemos que hay detalles en los que tenemos que ponernos al día, es por eso que estamos trabajando en temas de remodelación, algunos ya concluidos como restaurant, terraza, salones, lobby y actualmente fachada y habitaciones. Aunque estas ultimas nos llevaran un poco mas de tiempo le podemos asegurar que todas entraran en este proceso. En cuanto a tarifa se refiere estas pueden variar dependiendo de la agencia por la cual haya reservado y en ese caso cualquier tema relacionado con su reservación debe ser resuelto por su agencia. Lamentamos no haber podido cumplir con sus expectativas en este viaje. Si desea darnos una segunda oportunidad e ir constatando los cambios le estaremos esperando siempre con el afán de brindarle una mejor experiencia.  Saludos cordiales!! Jorge Rodriguez Argemi Gte.

146,Very good choice ,5,3,2020,Hassan H,"Stayed twice in this lovely hotel.  The rooms were spacious and clean. Toiletries are available for your comfort. Strong wifi.  Staff are amazing,  they are making sure to help you beyond your expectations.  The ladies in the reception desk are doing the best to make your check in and out experiences so express.  The lady speaks English was very professional and so respectful.  The location is so central and excellent,  with many groceries nearby. The breakfast buffet was good to go, but need more improvements for the variety of dishes.  The omelette and pancakes live cooking station was wonderful.  Great value for money.

147,"Not 4 star , more like 3",3,2,2020,Brandylady,"I googled this hotel it was supposed to be 4 star but I definitely  would say 3 !   Hotel is centrally located and looks great from the street . The reception and meeting area along with bar are nice on entry. We stayed 3 nights in a room on the 3rd floor looking out on the Main Street it’s on, therefore a lot of street noise and traffic all night .  Room was large enough and beds were comfy and clean but it was seriously in need of fresh decor with cracks on walls and peeling paint .Also the curtains did not meet due to them coming  away from the rail.  Bathroom had an old bath with fixed shower above  and sink had no plug and taps were so close to the wall it was difficult to get them to turn to get them on!  The room did have a safe and a coffee maker with one sachet of coffee provided . Only 2 electric sockets in room - found this not enough for charging our phones , iPads , fit bits etc Restaurant for breakfast was on 10th floor - nice and airy and pleasant staff but not enough of them on and there were queues to get in every morning for breakfast . Breakfast was a buffet ( average) and  you always had to wait ages to get a server to come with coffee and it was only powdered creamer on the table so I got round this by taking my cup to the cereal area to get fresh milk ...... when there was Some there , but this seemed to run out quickly . There were no teaspoons at all in the whole restaurant we used our knife handles to stir our coffee. Also people kept going to other tables to borrow salt as not every table had a salt cellar .long queues for eggs/ omelettes etc  To be honest breakfast was chaos .…","Responded Feb 21, 2020","Response from Sofia Garduño, Otro at Hotel Fontan ReformaResponded Feb 21, 2020","Apreciable Brandy.

148,Well placed hotel,3,2,2020,Colinsweeney,"We stayed three nights in this hotel, the first one before we started on an organised tour of Mexico. It is well placed in walking distance of the historic centre and downtown. The staff were friendly but I got the impression a number of them were training in hotel management. The attached picture was the view from our hotel window on the first night. We went out for a trip to see the Frida Kahlo and Trotsky museums on the first day. When we came back we couldn’t get into our room as the key didn’t work. When I told reception I was told we had been moved as part of our formal tour. We still needed to get our belongings out of the first room. When I got into the room, the safe, which I am sure I locked was wide open. Fortunately nothing was stolen. The next night after another tour, all of our party returned to their rooms to find their keys didn’t work. Again that night our safe was wide open although again I am sure I locked it. The final night again the key didn’t work but this time the safe was locked. Clearly there was some issue with the key mechanism and I am not certain how secure the safe system was.…","Responded Feb 13, 2020","Response from SofiaGP-CalidadHFR, Calidad HFR at Hotel Fontan ReformaResponded Feb 13, 2020","Apreciable huésped, antes que nada, le agradecemos el valioso tiempo que se toma para expresarnos sus comentarios, los cuales nos sirven para orientarnos día a día sobre las necesidades y expectativas de quienes nos honran con su confianza de elegirnos como su hotel.

149,Great place for the young and gay folks,4,6,2022,Pete Araiza,"The location is #1 if you like clubs, sex shops, restaurants, and being able to walk to a lot of places.  The service is great at the hotel, except at the restaurant.  I judge a place by how fast I can get a coffee refill.  At this place, I had my non-coffee drinkers ask for coffee so I could have a second mini cup ready.  But, people are very friendly and willing to always talk and help out.  The hotel is very pretty, and our room was small, but, our plan was not to hang out in our hotel room.

They did it to us. Managers did not want to talk to us and front desk were upset with us because we were asking for the money that they took from us.

158,Business Hotel with Spectacular Service; However Noisy Interior,4,7,2021,CandyManMia,"Spent 4 nights attending a business event. The rooms are comfortable, clean and the service; both in the hotel and restaurant is excellent.   Couple of things that could make it better; the hallways are generally noisy because of travelers going or coming from the airport, the walls are extremely thin so you will hear the conversation, TV, etc. from your adjacent room neighbors. Also, the shower could be interpreted as a rain shower; it is a pity the pressure is low.  The restaurant serves a variety of dishes and all with high quality and excellent flavor.   The hotel offers a shuttle to and from the airport.  The area is not for walking nor exploring, you will need transportation to go any place.","Responded Aug 5, 2021","Response from Ecommerce Hotel Riazor-Casa de la luz-Tezontle, Ventas at Hotel RiazorResponded Aug 5, 2021","Dear CandyManMia  Thanks for your feedback, you help us a lot with all your comments.

159,A gem in Mexico City,5,3,2020,Mike D,"What a great find! The Riazor is not just an excellent value but an excellent hotel. The staff is friendly and accommodating, the facility is clean and equipped, the pool, hot tub, sauna, and gym are all top notch, the cafe and restaurant have good food and great prices, there’s a 24-hour full service, non-limited menu (breakfast then lunch > late night) the grounds are safe and secure, and it’s typically a ten to twenty minute drive. If you are familiar with Mexico City traffic that is fast.  I thought this would be an inexpensive hotel with some nice pics but it was not. Very comfortable rooms. The suite was huge, the mattress was very comfortable, the bathroom was great, and a full size table for room service. If in Mexico City I will return. Definitely worth your time.  Useful tips:  Be aware of gratuity. $100 pesos is $5.00 US so $40 to $50 is fine for short cab trips. Tipping $100 is a lot! The Riazor does have shuttle service that runs on the hour. Go to Puerto 4 at Terminal 1, call the hotel, and they’ll be there quickly. Take a cab to a large market and pay them to wait. Pick up big bottles of drinking water and hand sanitizer.…","Responded Mar 12, 2020","Response from Ecommerce Hotel Riazor, Ventas at Hotel RiazorResponded Mar 12, 2020","Dear NocturnalTourist1  Thanks for your feedback, we´re happy to know that you enjoyed our service and facilities.

Breakfast was good.   On check out they weren’t able to find my payment and they wanted me to pay again and one of the biggest issues is how come a hotel doesn’t have anyone who could communicate properly in English most of the front desk staff weren’t able to communicate properly in English or express what they want to say or understand what I want to say.

However, we found that service was lacking. Unfortunately our transfer, arranged with the hotel, did not show up at the airport. This meant we wasted a lot of time waiting and searching for a transfer that was not there and ultimately arranged our own taxi. We were surprised that there wasn’t an apology from the hotel. We were told they would investigate but we never heard anything back. Another useful point to note is that the bathroom walls do not go all the way to the ceiling meaning there isn’t much privacy in the bathroom.

I got back at 3 and was told that the room would be ready in 30 mins, I ended up waiting an hour and ten minutes. The check in process is also long which is probably no fault of the guest service agent and has to do with the room management system they use, nonetheless they could have used that time to explain the amenities they have to offer, which they never did.  I had to figure them out on my own. Keys seem to expire each day no matter how many days youre staying and don’t bother taking a bottle of water or cup of Starbucks up to the terrace, they will turn you away, no outside food/drink allowed.

And there was no mini-refrigerator. or enough places to sit (only 1 chair) other than the bed. Sort of like being in an inside cabin on a cruise ship. Which we do not choose. And he air conditioner shut off by itself seemingly every 5 hours.  Great restaurant at the top of it. Luis is the best waiter you'll find! And an old time elevator you can drive yourself.

I was attracted to the hotel as it has a rooftop bar and restaurant which is also used to serve Breakfast. Under Covid 19 this was a very useful addition. the hotel staff were very friendly, the room was nice and well appointed. we had two beds which made the space tight but the very high ceilings made it feel more spacious.

190,Lots of noise! Not soundproof!,2,12,2018,Jaime C,"Th good: Great location. Room facilities and decor are good considering the price. Good and reliable WiFi. Nice views of the city.  The bad: The one reason why I will NEVER come back to this hotel is NOISE. There was a group of people who were having a small party on Saturday night in a room on the same floor (6th) I was staying. They were drunk, yelling and singing. The doors of this hotel are absolutely not soundproof. Isn't it a basic requirement, almost common sense, that doors in any decent medium/large hotel, be sound proof? I am very tolerant of noise but the noise this people were making felt almost as if they were in my room, or as if I had left the door wide-open. Even worse, I was able to hear (and very loudly) how the hotel staff walked through the corridors, banged on the doors and yelled ""Servicio!"" multiple times when they were delivering room service. I had to call the front desk twice to complain.  I also don't care much about light when I sleep. The gap at the bottom of the doors are so big that a significant amount of light from the corridor was coming into the room. This was not a major issue for me but I can see that I would be an issue for other people.…","Responded Dec 14, 2018","Response from HPF1, Director de Relaciones Públicas at Hotel & Suites PFResponded Dec 14, 2018","Dear Jaime,   We appreciate your comment.

193,Large floor plan.  Low standard!,3,5,2022,G Wesley K,"This hotel's facilities fall below the standard for a Marriott property.  While the hotel's (front of house) staff was helpful, the facilities are becoming quite tired and in need of some repair and renovation.  The size of the suite was quite nice, but even basic amenities were very scarce:   - In the bathroom, one bar of soap, two bath towels, and no wash cloths. - Only two *small* bottles of water were in the room.  (Bottled water is essential in this part of the world! ) - Ice buckets aren't  even standard items in the rooms, and only one ice machine in the hotel is operative.   - There's no full-length mirror in the room.  When ordering room service, the service items are delivered with a Rubbermaid utility cart and placed on a coffee table in the room.  There's no place to eat the food, and you end up with service items everywhere!  One thing I found very disappointing is that my ""superior"" room was advertised as having two queen-sized beds, which turned out to be two full-size beds.  The blackout curtains didn't come anywhere *close* to meeting each other in the middle of a HUGE window.   The indoor, heated pool is actually a nice feature.

First of all, I arrived on a Friday and there was no concierge to speak of on Friday, or Saturday. Very weird.  Next, I ordered breakfast through room service three times and all three times it was a total fiasco. They messed up the order every single time! They would go back to get something they forgot and they would forget to bring it. Inexcusable.  They recommended a restaurant and when I got there, it was closed. They recommended to me a park and a museum on a Monday and I went all the way there and both were closed, because Mondays museums and parks are apparently closed in Mexico City.

It was also very nice having the living room space -- not typical for a regular hotel room.  I would NOT recommend the expensive breakfast -- it was very average for the price and there are much better options close by.  My main issue is with the building itself.   This used to be an Embassy Suites and the way they re-did this building so that it is now 'encased' in an outer layer, was really short-sighted. When you now look out the window, you see an empty space of about 5 feet with a big metal diagonal cross beam and then a SECOND SET of windows -- so that you really can't clearly see any view clearly -- not well designed!  Also, the shower didn't drain properly, so by the end of the shower, your feet are standing in the bathtub water.

200,Nice big comfortable room with two TVs in Mexico City ideally located.,5,4,2022,7ContinentGal,"I like this hotel but it has a few flaws. My housekeeping in my room wasn't great when I got there. I talked to the person in the front lobby and they immediately fixed it so I want to say that all the problems were solved within 2 hours of me speaking to someone. And the head housekeeper is very nice gentleman who wants to make sure that everybody's happy and gives five star services for certainty. The rooms are huge and every room is a suite in the hotel. They have a swimming pool but it's in the basement which I don't like and it could be deeper but it is a pool and it's open until 11:00 p.m. which is great. Staff extremely professional look of the hotel she can modern. Would I stay here again ,? A resounding yes lots of great restaurants nearby staff is very helpful there was only one person that didn't know what she was doing. I was very happy with my 5 days there I paid $120 US dollars a day including tax and that was a pretty good value. I like the area the hotels in it feels pretty safe and there's lots of restaurants nearby. I didn't eat anything at the hotel but I would imagine that the food was good. My room came with a microwave a refrigerator and a sink but it would have been a little bit more helpful if they had two knives two forks two spoons and a wine bottle opener. But that's nitpicking.

202,Decent hotel in challenging neighbourhood,3,9,2018,546everclear,"One or two of the reviews of this hotel are surprisingly extreme - probably bad experiences exacerbated by the language problem, i.e. the lack of English spoken.  The area is not nice - it suited me to stay round there - but keep your head down and it should be fine.  The subway is not far.  Room was huge and quite secure.  (TV is not all porn, that is a ridiculous statement.)  Yes, the lack of English at the desk is annoying, but you get used to it in Mexico City.  Yes, the restaurant shutting on Sunday is a pain, but the poor man works all the hours going.  (He also has a bit of English and is a decent guy.)","Responded Sep 7, 2021","Response from Atención al Cliente, Propietario at Hotel Escala Siglo XXIResponded Sep 7, 2021","Thank you very much for your comments, we have changed administration and now we are Hotel Escala Siglo XXI.

203,RUN DO NOT STAY HERE!!!! !!!!,1,3,2018,taylor3500,"Warning do NOT stay at this hotel. We got suckered in by an Expedia agent who suggested this was a ""Nice clean hotel""  This hotel is in an extremely rough area of town. The rooms do NOT have proper locks on the door. For the first time we decided to barricade the door for some small level of security with chairs and tables in the room.  The TV shows nothing but free porn which was pretty damn nasty, the beds had burn holes from cigarettes and the sheets themselves were arguably clean.  For $88 on Expedia I STRONGLY do not suggest this hotel. Maybe for $25 if you have no other options.   Picture posted below is our safety concerns and lack of a deadbolt lock.","Responded Sep 7, 2021","Response from Atención al Cliente, Propietario at Hotel Escala Siglo XXIResponded Sep 7, 2021","Thank you very much for your comments, we have changed administration and now we are Hotel Escala Siglo XXI.

204,"Nice Stay, Not Great, But Nice",4,2,2018,Denae K,"My family took a week long trip to Mexico City to enjoy the heart of Mexico and try to do so as affordably as possible. In our quest for affordable accommodations, we found Hotel Plaza Solis.   Just a 12-15 min drive from Historic Centro or Paseo de la Reforma, this hotel is located perfectly for tourists. You are far enough away from the main attractions that you're not kept awake by the hustle and bustle of the busy city center, but not so far away that it takes forever to get somewhere. We always took a taxi to and from our hotel and if you make them run the meter (highly suggested so you don't get swindled), it shouldn't cost much more than 80 pesos/trip.   As many reviews prior have pointed out, this hotel has very hard beds. This indeed is true. However, as someone who has back problems, they were not uncomfortable to sleep on and I enjoyed a full nights rest throughout our stay. The bathroom was clean and the shower was enjoyable. We didn't want our room cleaned, but we did need fresh towels so we had to ask. Luckily I speak a bit of Spanish and was able to articulate what we wanted and didn't want. There was only one man who worked there that could speak English but he was not there often. So, just as a fair warning, if you don't speak Spanish or don't have a translator app handy, you will not be able to communicate with the staff. As for food, there are really only two options that we found: the hotel restaurant and the bakery down the street.   The hotel restaurant, Alcazar, offered a decent selection of goodies and filled our tummies more than once. The bakery down the street (take a left out of the hotel and go down a few blocks and it's on the left) was delicious. However, I would advise not spending too much time walking the streets if you don't blend in with the locals. While walking the streets we were approached by a local who essentially told us to get off the street. It was a bit unnerving, but we just learned to shorten our street time and catch a cab ASAP after exiting the hotel.   Overall, this was a great place to stay and came at a fair price. We enjoyed our time with Hotel Plaza Solis and I would recommend it to future Mexico City travelers.…","Responded Sep 7, 2021","Response from Atención al Cliente, Propietario at Hotel Escala Siglo XXIResponded Sep 7, 2021","Thank you very much for your comments, we have changed administration and now we are Hotel Escala Siglo XXI.

205,Great Value-Surrounded by Locals -Loved It!,5,2,2018,Dayla Kay ;-),"My Mom, Daughter, and I stayed there for a week (Saturday, January 20th - Saturday January 27th, 2018). I had read many reviews about the hard beds; yes the beds are hard but we all slept all night with no fatigue! We stayed on the 6th floor (room 601) so there was no noise above us or around us to keep us up at night. Actually, we were all happy about how quiet the entire hotel was! The bathroom was clean, spacious and the shower was large and the water was consistently hot and the water pressure was amazing. The room had plenty of storage for our clothes.  The restaurant downstairs was so fast and yummy; I would recommend eating there a few times to try several items (pastries, tacos, omelets, salads, hot tea- many varieties of hot tea). The restaurant also delivers to your room; we did not do that but many times we passed them in the hallway delivering meals to hotel guests.  The front desk does not speak any English so make sure you have the Google Translate App on your phone so you can communicate with them just in case you do not know enough Spanish.  There is a local Lady that will do your laundry just around the corner (109 is on her garage door). We dropped off our clothes and picked them up washed and folded the next day after noon. If you walk out the front door, follow Antonio Solis Street to the right, turn right on the very next street and walk about a block, and just knock on the white garage door (109) and she will come down and help you!!! She is amazing! There is a bakery just to the left of the Hotel on Antonio Solis; they are a perfect place to grab a breakfast snack.  The taxi cabs are constantly driving right in front of the Hotel; make sure you use a cab with a meter so you do not get ripped off. If traffic is normal, it will never cost you more than 80 pesos to get to Reforma Street where all the big restaurants are.  So, I recommend you stay at this hotel if you want to see the sites and are willing to be away from the main action of Mexico. You will be surrounded by locals but they are all very nice and we had no problems!!! Oh, and they can hook you up with Tours right at your hotel if you want to do that! Most Sincerely! NO COMPLIANTS!!!!…","Responded Sep 7, 2021","Response from Atención al Cliente, Propietario at Hotel Escala Siglo XXIResponded Sep 7, 2021","Thank you very much for your comments, we have changed administration and now we are Hotel Escala Siglo XXI.

DO NOT Go there,  it felt like a prostitution ring, hard matress, the room does NOT come with FAN/AIRCON.   To upgrade, pay another 30 USD,  no FOOD served, restaurant closes on Sunday. Only restaurant nearby was DOMINOS,  STAFF WAS SLOW, doesnt understand ENGLISH,  and all night long there were loud noises from outside, girls laughing and screaming.  cheap pillows and blanket and DINGY small lift. I regret every moment of it but since i already paid i had to endure the night.

209,"Warning: Never ever go here, awful experience!",1,10,2021,Lotte V,"So, it started when we booked a room 2 days in advance. Both Booking.com and the hotel confirmed this booking. We chose this hotel because we wanted to stay close to the AirPort (because of a transit flight). After a long day of traveling, we arrived at 11 pm at city express AirPort hotel. After the lady in de lobby looked at her computer, she said that the booking was there but that they ‘gave’ our room to someone else and that they had no room available for us. I couldn’t believe this at first because I never experienced anything like this (and I have traveled a lot). Because I was so tired I stood there crying in the hotel lobby, it was late at night in a strange city en we (me and my boyfriend) didn’t know where to go. The lady told us she would call another hotel where we could have a room for the same rate. By the way, the whole staff treated us with zero respect.   A taxi arrived and we had to pay this ourselves (and it was way too much!). But again, we were super tired and just wanted to sleep. We went to city express plaza, a hotel in a bad neighbourhood and it was just a worse hotel overall. I Asked the reception if our experience at the AirPort hotel happens more often with other tourists , and the lady confirmed this. So, the next day I did some research and found many similar stories, all of people who arrived late and were to tired to complain.   So, this feels like some kind of scam: if you arrive late and tired, they sent you away to a cheaper hotel and let you pay the price of the expensive hotel. They make it seem like they ‘saved’ you but they start the problem and make you pay for it.   Booking.com is helping me to get my money back, both from the taxi’s and the overpriced cheap hotel we eventually slept. I Will write to the city express branch, so hopefully, other tourists won’t have to go through the same experience. For me, this is a hotel unworthy of Mexico (it’s such a nice country with many lovely people).

I just called and the girl from reception just told me, no we don't provide transportation.

242,"Happy, smiley people.",5,2,2019,Philip751,"When I was recommended this place I was s little dubious due to its proximity to the airport but on arrival all doubts disappeared. The entrance to the  building is s sweeping driveway  bordered by some wonderfully kept gardens that take you to a clean and tidy portico.  The entrance/foyer is large and roomy and the reception is located in a good obviously place on the left ( this isnt always the case in some hotels where you have to hunt for reception). The reception staff greeted me with ENORMOUS smiles and could not help me enough even dragging my toolbox to my room without asking or even hinting for the obligatory tip. The room I had was large and airy and supplied with everything that I needed. The small downside was that the fridge didn't work but this was replaced without fuss. The room and ensuite bathroom were clean and again the bathroom had everything I would need. The breakfast area was large and easily accommodated all guests and the breakfast available was impressive.  The bar area was comfortable and there is a substantial garden at the rear of the building which had many chairs, tables and umbrellas to make ditting outside, even at midday comfortable.  All this may sound a little 'ordinary' and what you would expect at and hotel of this type but what sets this hotel apart from the others is the permanent, and in my opinion,  genuine smiles on the faces of all the staff.  It appeared to me that they actually enjoy working at this hotel and girls me that makes the experience much more enjoyable.   There are many hotels in this part of Toluca but I really must emphasise how pleasant it was to stay here and I will definitely stay here again in the future.

Exactly as you would expect from a Courtyard. The only downside - has absolutely nothing to do with the hotel- is if you are coming from the other side (as if going to the airport) and if you miss the exit, the next one is quite a ways ahead and it becomes a headache, especially in heavy traffic.

From a service point, it was good.. staff speaks English and helps you around. Room service etc. is also good.  For the sessions and event, we had booked a banquet hall outside in the backspace. It was very well managed.. the snacks, food and the attention given to everyone was precise.. the team helped us with lots and went out of their way to accommodate smaller requests.

The room was clean and neat but the amenities were very limited (shower gel and shampoo, bar soap, hair dryer and towels) don’t expect slippers, shaving kit, dental kit or even coffee and tea; all of that has to be paid for separately and not sure that they even had slippers. The internet speed was ok. Breakfast is served to table after selecting from an online menu. I tried the laundry service and it was too slow where for regular clothes (nothing special) it took me three days to get back mine and I had called already four times and promised to have them (soon!) at the last time after I waited two hours I had to leave and casually asking the receptionist she handed them to me!!

283,For the price tag I’d pass,3,11,2021,ahmadeldeeb,"First surprise was that the hotel name sign was having three letters out as of a cheap hotel which I thought might be due to recent earthquake and they will fix it during my stay (10+ days). The check-in was fast and good however I wanted to change my room as the first had a platform directly below it and the receptionists were very fast to address that issue fast. The room was clean and neat but the amenities were very limited (shower gel and shampoo, bar soap, hair dryer and towels) don’t expect slippers, shaving kit, dental kit or even coffee and tea; all of that has to be paid for separately and not sure that they even had slippers. The internet speed was ok. Breakfast is served to table after selecting from an online menu. I tried the laundry service and it was too slow where for regular clothes (nothing special) it took me three days to get back mine and I had called already four times and promised to have them (soon!) at the last time after I waited two hours I had to leave and casually asking the receptionist she handed them to me!! The gym has some good equipment for a nice workout, mostly cardio (stationary cycling, treadmill…) but had no towels and lighting is dimmer than normal.

It takes long time for the restaurant tables to been cleaned after a guest finished the meal, so even nobody is using the table, no one can sit there because the table is dirty.

The only surprise was that they forgot to put a hold on my card for incidentals, which resulted in one of them chasing me down for cash to pay for the dinner I had in the restaurant.  This was handled with an incredible amount of grace and they must be credited for that.  The restaurant itself delivered an average burger and fries.  I probably would have gotten better results at the nearby McDonald's.  The room itself was all right, but I could have sworn that the floor was uneven.  I also noted that the quality of the materials used in the bathroom was all over the place, and hot water was a challenge.  As far as value for what I spent, that was not so good.

340,Worse than expected,2,12,2019,Khaled I,"I expected the hotel to be average. I thought it’s decent enough from the pictures.  We wanted a hotel with indoor pool.

The first impression was not good because I didn’t find someone who speaks English  and even on the phone, I waited like 5 min for them to find someone who speaks English.  The room’s odour was too strong, and when we turned the Air-con to warm, it emitted bad smell.  The floor and the mirror was not really clean, but the rest of the room was clean.  We took a day use there. So, we went to the gym and the swimming pool.  The gym is basic, so basic. It has that equipment that includes different types of exercises. Med-ball, few dumbbells, bar without any weights, and a some treadmills.  The swimming pool was dark and the water was not deep at all, for adults. There floor was to the swimming pool was wet and I slipped and fell.  The water didn’t really look clean, like there was oil in the water.  The breakfast was ok. They were responsive when I ordered more towels ( I had to figure out towels in Spanish though in order to order them.  The main problem is that the price is not any cheaper than other hotels.

341,More negatives than positives ,3,12,2019,insanidiy,"The first thing that hits you when you enter the hotel is the smell. Very strong, supposedly good smell. The lobby is just masked with fragrance that it made me dizzy and breathless. When we got up to the floor where our room was, I understood why they put such strong perfume. They tried very hard to cover the musty smell of the hotel.   The hotel is old. It’s design seems to be stuck in the 80s. And signs of wear and tear can be seen here and there.  But they did try to cover these up with a fresh coat of paint.   The beds and pillows were comfy and the rooms are adequately clean.  The drawbacks include a very noisy air conditioning unit, noisy streets and poor plumbing (water cannot be contained within the shower area and the toilet does not stop flushing unless you turn off the tap at the bottom of the toilet bowl).   Breakfast was good. They were able to provide food despite guests coming down late for breakfast.   We booked this hotel because of their indoor pool. Sad to say the Pool area was dark and dingy (it was a cloudy day in Monterrey and they did not turn on the lights until sunset) and the Pool steps were very unstable.   We also used their gym. Very basic and some equipments were old.   All in all a pretty average stay for me. Borderline poor.

390,"No Air Conditioning No internet,",1,6,2021,Tram,"The property is somewhat nice.  But if it's 74F outside they will shut off the chillers and the entire hotel will be very hot.  If you want your room to be 70F don't even consider staying here.  You will never achieve a temperature below 76F.  If you think you will be able to connect to the internet to do your work, forget it.  There is no internet in this hotel.  The TV is fuzzy.  The property seems nice at first glance, but they are penny pinchers and they don't seem to care if guests are miserable.  I have stayed in this hotel a few times because of the good location.  But because I have experienced the exact same issues with the AC on every stay, I have decided to not stay at this hotel again.  The decision to turn off the chillers when the outside temperature drops a little is going to destroy this property.  I can adjust to many situations, but I can't adjust to being HOT!

391,"Location, Location, Location",5,11,2020,weatherman1974,"I selected Hotel Krystal Monterrey for eight consecutive nights in November 2020 for my tourism-related visit to Monterrey. The location of the hotel in the center of the city, the high ranking of the hotel on TripAdvisor, and the very positive description of the hotel in the Lonely Planet Mexico guidebook were the main reasons for me selecting this lodging.  Making a reservation was a simple and straightforward process. Using the hotel's official website, I selected my preferred room type (King Junior Suite – Bed and Breakfast) and dates of stay. After entering the details of my credit card to secure my reservation, I was immediately e-mailed a reservation voucher, which I eventually printed and brought with me when I departed for Monterrey.  When I arrived at General Mariano Escobedo International Airport, a taxi from the airport to the hotel was a fixed fare of $300 MXN and took about 30 minutes in light afternoon traffic. And when I arrived at the hotel, the check-in process with the receptionist, during which I paid the balance of my stay in full and received my room key card, was fast and efficient.  The bedroom of my room (#317) featured a king-size bed with four large pillows and sheets and comforter of excellent quality. Two nightstands, a small round table with two chairs and an overhead lamp, a dresser, an armchair, and a flat screen television with satellite were also present. An adjoining room contained a writing desk with chair, sofa, two end tables, an armchair, a closet, and a flat screen television with satellite. In-suite amenities included adequate air conditioning and wi-fi, an iron and ironing board, and a security safe. The sweeping view from my room was of the Plaza Hidalgo, buildings nearby and in the distance, and mountains located to the south and southeast of the hotel.  The bathroom featured a walk-in shower stall with rainhead shower head, ample hot water and strong water pressure, and large and clean towels (with an occasional stain, however). Amenities in the bathroom included a hair dryer, a makeup mirror, and a small selection of toiletries. American-style power outlets were located in the bathroom and throughout the suite. Housekeeping was quick and efficient and did an excellent job freshening the bathroom and entire suite each day. However, due to the current COVID pandemic, housekeeping was not automatic and had to be requested daily, either through the receptionist at the front desk or directly through housekeeping staff.  In the mornings, breakfast (included in my rate, otherwise it’s $260 MXN) consisted of pre-prepared plates of sliced fruit (pineapple, papaya, watermelon, and cantaloupe) and pan dulce (two to three small pieces). Eggs cooked to your liking were also served (I chose eggs scrambled with cheese and pieces of bacon), as well as refried beans, orange juice, and coffee. This breakfast setup was the result of the suspension of the hotel’s daily breakfast buffet due to the current COVID pandemic. The breakfast was filling and the service was excellent each morning during my stay (I tipped the waitstaff $30 MXN to $50 MXN each morning).  As mentioned in the first paragraph of this review, the location of the hotel in the center of Monterrey was one of the main reasons for me choosing Hotel Krystal Monterrey for my time in the city. I found currency exchange and several pharmacies in the near-immediate vicinity of the hotel, with numerous restaurants and tourism-related sites all within easy walking distance.  For eight consecutive nights at Hotel Krystal Monterrey, I paid $13,387.80 MXN ($657.81 USD). Upon completion of my stay, the transfer by taxi from the hotel to the airport took about 20 minutes in light mid-morning traffic and cost $400 MXN ($300 MXN fare + $45 MXN toll + $25 MXN tip).  For a future trip to Monterrey, I would have no problem selecting Hotel Krystal Monterrey again for my lodging, and would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone considering staying in Monterrey for business or leisure.…","Responded Dec 1, 2020","Response from Krystal Monterrey, Director General at Krystal MonterreyResponded Dec 1, 2020",Dear guest:  It has been a pleasure to have received your visit in our property.

The front desk staff treats you like trash because they think they have some right to act snobby in this hotel. And the front desk manager Mrs. Jaramillo could care less about making you feel welcomed and making up for the mistakes of her front desk staff. The food is also trying to too hard to be American so they don't get either the Mexican or the American food right  - they both suffer. The amenities are also a joke.

395,Loved the location in the historic city center but wouldn't rush back,3,12,2019,laviajeraliz,"There were several minor things that kept this from being a great choice. The amenities in the room are pretty basic. I'm not a big fan of rain showers.  Would have appreciated a shower cap to avoid getting my head wet.  Would also have liked a face cloth.  Towels smelled funny.  WiFi wasn't great—periodically times out. Breakfast service wasn't kind of strange. The woman at the egg station is great! But other things . . . The items on the buffet weren't replenished very promptly so there were times when breads and fruit were sparse. Butter only on request?  One day there was no fruit preserves.  The settings at the table weren't put out very carefully so one day there were no napkins, another day no knives.  I had trouble controlling the temperature in my room. The temperature seemed to vary during the night.  I wish I could have turned off the thermostat and opened a window but the windows don't open.

The true reason I am writing this review is to congratulate the staff on providing your guests with an outstanding hospitality experience. There are two people that were extremely helpful and made our stay particularly enjoyable: Pamela from front desk and Mr. Alfredo, concierge services.  I truly could not believe how great they treated us. They were courteous, respectful and very helpful. They went above and beyond in making sure that our stay was perfect and that everything went without a hitch.   I even attempted to find the general manager to commend them. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to, but I hope that this review reaches management. People like Ms Pamela and Mr Alfredo are hard to find in hospitality now a days. Cherish them.

412,Amazing,5,2,2020,John K,"I stayed at this lovely hotel on the nights of February 7th and 8th room 621. I was in Monterrey for a business trip and spent the weekend at Fiesta Americana Pabellon M hotel. The hotel was one of the finest I've stayed at in a very long time. 4 stars fit the bill  I was impressed with the kindness and professionalism the staff displayed and the service was also exceptional. I believe Luis is the manager of the bar and was pleasantly surprised and impressed with his knowledge of the English language and kindness he had for me of knowing little to no Spanish. He is definitely an asset to the hotel. Lulu was my bartender and she also displayed impeccable hospitality and was able to make the drinks I asked for and she was also courteous and holds her own with the English language. Israel also displayed exceptional hospitality and took the time to explain the two soccer teams playing each other during my time at the bar.    The room was amazing with large windows and a view of the mountains and the city. The room has a modern feel and the bed was comfortable. Great location if you want to be close to the center of Monterrey where thousands of people show up at the local shops on the weekend and it's only minutes away from the ritzy San Pedro.

416,Mixed experience,3,12,2019,George Y,"I like the location of the Fiesta Americana near the Centro. I also like our room and the high quality shower and bed. I thought the staff performance was uneven. Not very helpful, unsure of their English in some occasions, and slow at the reception. We also had a package delivered to our room which was not for us. The lobby is on a higher floor than the motor lobby and the motor lobby layout is strange as most space is given to the entrance and exit from the attached parking garage and only the far corner is provided for passengers embarking and disembarking from taxis and Ubers. The hotel is conveniently attached to a mall and there is a Starbucks on the lobby level.","Responded Apr 14, 2021","Response from Juan Carlos Castrejon, Director General at Fiesta Americana Monterrey Pabellon MResponded Apr 14, 2021","Thanks for your comments, we hope to see you soon.

418,Safi outdated,2,2,2022,Stay56156380186,"This place is tacky looking. It is like a wannabe Italian inspired but it is too much. The rooms are outdated. Super clean but the mattress looked higher at the feet than on the headrest. The locals seem to like it since you will see them posing at the staircase. If you are a traveler you will likely not be impressed. So hours prior to leaving California the ""Safi"" hotel calls me. You know how it says ""pay at the hotel"" well apparently they have trusting issues because they were trying to charge before my arrival. So we get their at 5 AM exhausted. And they no longer have our room. They offered a breakfast to compensate. Guess what? Never used their breakfast buffet. The person who runs the table reservation seemed overwhelmed and was not inviting at all so we were not feeling the good vibes from staff. This place is for the locals and it seems like us ""tourist"" are like ""whatever"" to them. Also the female staff if you ask them advice for in town information they have no clue. They will look at you confused. And we speak clear Spanish so it was not the language barrier. The concierge wasted our time and money. He made arrangements for taxi pick up to take us and take the cable car up to see the Grutas de Garcias. After a boring hour drive in the early morning we end up being told by the Grutas staff that cable cars are under maintenance for a period of time. And that information is given. So the concierge who knows who he talked to. So we ended up wasting time and money with a taxi that was pretty dirty and hot (no ac). …","Responded Mar 9, 2022","Response from Safi  Royal Luxury , Propietario at Safi Royal Luxury ValleResponded Mar 9, 2022",	Agradecemos como siempre su preferencia.

427,Terrible experience,1,5,2019,davidsoules,"First, we choose this hotel along Expedia thinking that it is at the first square of the City, to take it as reunion point and to walk the commercial area without problem.  When we arrive, they put us in a fifth-floor room, and all the floor smelled like party, lots of humidity and no signal of being cleaned soon (one maid told us they had no much people working that day and they had no chance to review every floor). The worst, when we entered the room the bathroom was broken, and the carpet stunk.  Ok, we took to the lobby and they moved us to the seventh floor, but they informed that they had no more king size beds available. Well, we took the room, with two beds, started to check how to be comfortable without danger for our little 7 months old baby. So, we take the pillows to think the best way to accommodate everything. Then, below one pillow there was a scorpion leg (did I said I have a 7mo baby?)  For that time, we preferred to run away, went to the lobby to inform them and they asked for my email and cell phone because ""the manager will call you"", for the inconvenience. And so, that call never came.  We move those two days to a friend guest room, and after the trip I called Expedia to tell them what happened. They did the manage with the hotel, and in the hotel, they said that they didn't know anything, and that there is no refunds.  Let me repeat it: A SCORPION LEG!!  Never visit the place guys.…","Responded Jun 30, 2019","Response from juan ignacio e, Gerente at Mision Monterrey Centro HistoricoResponded Jun 30, 2019","  Dear DavidSoules  We appreciate your opinion about your stay in our hotel, we are very sorry about the inconvenience that generated in your room.

440,"Good value, great view",3,9,2021,MartinfromDenmark,"I stayed in Radisson San Jerónimo for one week in September 2021. Fine location just next Galerias shopping mall about 5 mins away on foot. Staff in the reception were nice and friendly, rooms were nice and clean, with all standard amenities. Hotel offers laundry service. View is super good over Monterrey city - make sure you book a room with city view.  I did not have the chance to try the breakfast. Roof top area is nice, pool is ok, just a bit shallow, water only up to my waist. Also the balcony area outside of the canteen/lobby is perfect for a coffee, enjoying the view of the city and mountains at the same time. I do want to mention a few things which could be improved: Lounge sofas outside canteen and beach chairs on the roof are not the best quality - they feel quite cheap to sit in. More importantly though, they were quite dirty and not really inviting to sit in - see photos.  I would not expect this from Radisson, and this is perhaps what ultimately prevents me from rating this hotel 4 instead of 3 stars.  I paid around 54 USD per night.

I called to make a reservation, they proposed a rate and I agreed, so the non-refundable reservation was made.    When I arrived at the front desk for my check in, the rate was not honored claiming that taxes had not been added, and when I showed them the confirmation email with included taxes rates, then they blamed it on the Pesos to US dollars exchange, this was also not true as the rate had been given to me via phone.  The rate the front desk is waaaay higher and in Montse's words (front desk employee): ""this is what we have and cannot change it"" (honor the rate given to me when I made my reservation).

The pool needs a lot of work and repairs, I did write this comment 2 years ago and did not see any improvements on this visit. The gym needs new equipment, the workout machine that they have is very old and hard to use. I opted to pay 150 pesos daily to use the gym located in the shopping center. The only thing I like about this hotel is the location.  Lots of good restaurants, banks and pharmacies near by.

463,Business oriented rooms. Excellent location. Loved my stay.,4,10,2018,Alberto L,"I stayed here every week for a period of almost 3 months. The main reason was the great location. The hotel is a business class place with small rooms with few amenities but where you really don't need anything they don't offer. Designed for executives that only spend the night, this place is premium. If you don't like the house's small breakfast, you have plenty of alternatives available as the hotel is located in a shopping mall with plenty of restaurants to choose from. The mall or plaza has everything you may need (banks, restaurants, laundry, mobile phone companies, courier services, supermarket and even a movie theatre). Staff was always friendly, always. This also offers a great variety of different alternatives for lunch or dinner as the plaza gets many visitors. One thing management could improve is the slow coffee machine in the breakfast area, could upgrade. Super clean and comfortable rooms always (I tried many of them). Place is also great for short stays (families, etc). Most restaurants in the plaza offer a discount for hotel guests. Free parking is available.

Good coffee and fresh juice as well. Check in and out was easy and the free wifi was good too as I was able to do video conferencing without a problem.

Infrastructure and rooms are in good condition, rooms are large and comfortable (including an A/C that works well!!). Where this location need urgent attention is in the service side: (a) front desk experience was sub-standard, I think mainly because is under staffed; (b) Hotel has only 1 restaurant, which is perfectly fine for a HI, On this I will split my comments: (1) Morning service is suppose to start at 6:30AM, well by 7:00AM they have only half of things out, wont be until 7:30-8:00AM when is in full swing. So if you need to depart early in the morning plan a stop by a coffee shop. (2) Room Service is GREAT! fast, large variety and very good quality food.

482,"A mistake in booking, through Agado, meant I was totally ripped off.",2,8,2019,John E,"First the hotel. Nice enough, clean and reception staff helpfull. Don't expect a cooked breakfast if you are vegetarian! Even the scrambled eggs have meat in them. To the rip-off. I mistakenly booked for Aug instead of July, same dates. When I arrived and it was realised, I was told by the reception staff to contact the agent who would do a refund.Obviously I had to pay for the rooms now I was there, so I paid £454 on top of the £309 already paid to Agado. On my return to the UK I contacted Agado who then contacted the hotel. The hotel told them that they were not prepard to move on their policy that, if I didn't turn up on the Aug dates, it would be considered a no-show.  So for a 5 night stay the hotel has had £763 of my money, plus of course they will have filled the room that was vacant, presumably at the same £454. Total money made by the hotel through one simple mistake by a PAYING customer - £1214 for 5 nights.

483,"Very minor complaints, but otherwise perfect.",5,1,2019,ThisIsNotMe,"Stayed here for 5 days in January 2019 and was satisfied with my stay.   It's close to many restaurants and a large shopping centre, but the hotel itself also has a restaurant, which I ate at twice, and enjoyed the meals I had, especially the buffalo wings.  There's also a small convenience store with soda, snacks and toiletries, in case you need either.  The rooms were spacious and clean, and the beds were comfortable.  My room was facing north towards the school, and was very quiet.  Even though it was right beside the elevator, I was never disturbed by any elevator noises.  The Free WiFi worked fine for me during the entire length of my stay, but the TV had a few minor issues with reception.  My only complaint about my room in particular was the weak pressure on the shower, and the tub faucet being loose.  The staff, from the front desk to the food service, were polite and friendly.  I plan on coming to Monterrey again in the future, and will more than likely be staying here again when I do so.…","Responded Feb 16, 2019","Response from Tadeo M, Revenue Manager at Holiday Inn Monterrey Valle, an IHG HotelResponded Feb 16, 2019","Good evening estimated  First that at all, thank you for lodging with us, it makes us happy to listen that his stay was of his pleasure.

484,Good location with caveats,3,1,2019,JP-Woodlands,"Rooms can get very cold at night and one has to call the front desk every single night to remind them to turn the heating on. The personnel always came up with a nonsense excuse explaining that the heating system only works when the outside temperature falls below a certain level. I have stayed at hundreds of hotels all over the world and this is the first hotel I stay in that monitors the temperature in the outside to control the temperature inside of the building. It is weird, to say the least...  The front desk personnel could have been a little bit more kind and understanding instead of resorting to cookie-cutter, nonsense responses.   We have stayed at this hotel two years in a row. In both instances, the room keeper always left only 3 towels no matter how many times we reminded her we were a family of four.  We had to call every single day in order to request the missing extra towel. We also tried addressing the issue with the front desk but to no avail.    On the good side: Rooms have a good size, Wi-Fi is kind of decent most of the time, Parking is free but way too dusty and dirty…","Responded Jan 18, 2019","Response from IHGService, Guest Relations Manager at Holiday Inn Monterrey Valle, an IHG HotelResponded Jan 18, 2019","Hello JP-Woodlands,  Thank you for your staying with us again and for taking the time to leave us feedback.

They advertise themselves as a business hotel but have very limited business services. No dollar exchange services.

Sleep quality is good if you are a heavy sleeper. If you have trouble falling asleep, noise will keep you up (doors slamming, shoes clacking, loud / rude guests, aircraft frying overhead)  Being a value hotel, expect to find loud and rough guests (families will small loud kids, blue collar workers, mid level executives loud answering their cell phones) Hotel does LITTLE to enforce a 'lower your voice and keep it quiet' policy.","Responded Feb 6, 2019","Response from Angeles J, Gerente at One Monterrey AeropuertoResponded Feb 6, 2019","Thank you very much for your comments, hope to see you back soon!

My friends and I happened upon this hotel while arriving in the central bus station, where we were offered a discounted stay for the weekend. We booked and arrived! It's a little rough on the outside but don't get scared away.   The rooms are cozy and spacious! Loved the bed. The view isn't amazing but we're not at the beach. They're kept clean as well.   Don't forget to try out the enchiladas about a block away towards the back of the hotel and mention you're a guest; you get a 20% discount if I remember correctly. That's beside the point though, the enchiladas are to die for!   Oh and don't get taxi's without a fare meter!! You'll be charged outrageously if you do.

There was everything you needed  and aso it´s location is what really  makes this hotel cool,for everything is near you! I mean,it is in the middle of downtown historic district and all other major hotels are around it. Airport it is only about 40 minutes from the hotel,so for the price you can beat this place.

Another issue we had the number of males in the area and hotel. Especially in the evenings. All the front area was lined up with men and the inside as well which Made us  feel very uncomfortable and unsafe. I wouldn't stay in this hotel again.

The hotel is pretty far from all the tourist attractions (if you were a visitor) but I was there for work and it was in a good position as I avoided most of the heavy traffic on the main roads in the morning. You have an apparently fancy bar right in front, where they actually select the clientele - have not been in it though. The prices were very good, though. So if you are looking for cheap but nice, then that is the place to be.","Responded Apr 19, 2019","Response from cpmsjgerencia, Gerente at City Express Plus Monterrey GaleriasResponded Apr 19, 2019","Thanks for your comments, we´re improvement and offer the best service.

518,Very nice hotel.   Definitely worth a look,5,8,2016,mark w,"I stayed first time at City Plus on a business trip.  I normally stay at chain hotels like Marriott or Sheraton but not this time.  My travel companion booked for me and budget was a concern for his company so I agreed.  It was super clean, modern and the staff were very friendly.  The night I stayed there they had a social with drinks and snacks.   The room was clean albeit Spartan but functional. The view was great overlooking the city. The price was great, low, compared to what you pay in a chain and breakfast plus internet was included. Great value for either business or vacation.  The hotel was also close to shopping and downtown.  I highly recommend giving City Plus hotel a look for your next trip to Mexico  Mark","Responded Apr 19, 2019","Response from cpmsjgerencia, Gerente at City Express Plus Monterrey GaleriasResponded Apr 19, 2019","Thanks for your comments, we´re improvement and offer the best service.

519,"Jessica norris, Boise, idaho",5,6,2022,Jessica N,"We stayed for a week at the Sheraton Buganvilias, partially for work, mostly for family fun! Our kids went to bed exhausted every night from swimming, playing on the beach, more swimming, and fantastic food and drinks, we loved every minute! Our breakfast waiter, Juanito-Marcos took exceptional care of us each morning, we intentionally would request him each morning because he goes above and beyond, be sure you sit with Juan for breakfast or lunch and he’ll take fantastic care of you! We’ll for sure be back for this work event annually and plan to make more vacations out of it as well.   When we arrived we’d had our room upgraded to an ocean front suite, the space was comfortable and clean and well stocked for our family. The showers were a hit for our kids, spacious and overhead rain shower, fantastic. Our rooms were tended to each day, we were given fresh towels and soap and our beds made. The staff around the resort were wonderful and helpful. We know a bit of Spanish, enough to get by well, but almost everyone here speaks English as well to some degree, which was helpful for longer conversations.

520,NEVER take your business group to this hotel!,1,6,2022,marias,"Went with a group of apx 60 people, for our annual convention. Service was simply awful. Drinks were watered, and food careless. When reserves were made at “specialty restaurants” (las gaviotas and an Italian one), they asked us to “first gather the party of 32”(!?) with an empty restaurant with tables of 8! At the bar, the waitress was complaining of the amount of orders she had to take… Following day, there was a quarrel among waiters right on our table!! As corollary, I forgot some clothes, and called 7 days later to retrieve them, and they were very comfortable saying that they didn’t find them… No excuses were offered,  no apologies… It was one of the worst experiences in my life, and I don’t recommend anyone to hold a meeting or convention there… I would love to talk to a manager to give more details…",Responded 6 days ago,"Response from Rodolfo Pacheco, Director General at Sheraton Buganvilias Resort & Convention CenterResponded 6 days ago","Hi Nomad56178339728,  We appreciate the time that you have invested in writing an overview of your stay with us.

521,"Restful vacation, nice hotel",5,6,2022,Frances D,"We stayed in the timeshare side which they call vacation club. Two different lobbies but the hotels are connected. This was a timeshare exchange for us so the price was great. The location is close enough to town that you can walk easily. If walking isn’t your thing there are buses and taxis readily available. We stayed here many years ago and really the only thing I remembered was the bed was horribly uncomfortable and I didn’t sleep well. Not much has changed. The bed was slightly better but no softness or give to the mattress. I would have hoped the Sheraton name would provide something better. The only other thing that’s bad here is Wi-Fi, so frustrating to log in with a code every single time and then go offline in the middle of an email. I’m still rating as a 5 star though. The grounds are well maintained and very nice. The pool is clean and always plenty of chairs although we aren’t traveling at peak season so I’m sure that’s not always the case. We weren’t sure if we would get daily housekeeping so we were pleasantly surprised. Every day our room was cleaned and fresh towels replenished. We were only approached for a timeshare pitch when we first got here and never again asked but it’s not peak travel season either. We had massages at the spa next door and it was great, very relaxing. We did not do the all inclusive and there really is no reason to. There are so many great restaurants nearby and the prices very reasonable. I used Yelp and TripAdvisor all week and we never had a bad meal. PV is much cheaper than Cabo for sure.

525,"Overall, nice and enjoyable but could be better.",3,6,2022,Jackie,"Overall, we really enjoyed the holiday, however, we would not return to the hotel as it was only okay.  Check in/lobby - - luggage handlers were very friendly and helpful which was a nice greeting. Also, the man that checked us in was lovely. - HOWEVER, as soon as we checked in we were pestered my a woman trying to sell us things such as spa discount, Wi-Fi and a tour and wanted 20 dollars as a deposit . After an 11 hour flight this is not what we wanted. Furthermore, this continued the entire holiday, they are lined up in the lobby waiting for you as you walk through to breakfast and the pool. If it hadn’t have been for this we would have had a spa treatment but we didn’t because of the hard sale.    Food-  Buffet was disappointing, we don’t really like buffets anyway but we found the food boring and average.  Breakfast- the omelettes were nice and freshly cooked eggs and bacon other than that it was just okay.  For evening meals we tended to book restaurant where the service was brilliant and the food was gorgeous/ the Italian or fish restaurant. We went to the Asian twice which you had to pay for, not included all inclusive but was gorgeous, we couldn’t have been more impressed.   Bars-  The lobby bar was poor, service was bad and waiters were lazy and rude especially when they realised they weren’t getting a tip (tips are for staff that are helpful and friendly and polite) We went to the embarcadero bar as the service here was amazing, the staff were very friendly and couldn’t do enough, we ended up tipping every night and the music in here was great whereas in the lobby bar it was rubbish and had sports on loud.  Also not all drinks are all included, although this did not bother us as there is a good selection it was slightly annoying.   Pool-  There are 2 pools one is lively and noisy and the other was quieter and bigger and the bar staff were very friendly. Weren’t too cold not too warm, they were nice.   Location of hotel-   Great location as it is only short walk to main old town which is very nice with lots of bars and restaurants. Beach isn’t amazing as it is stony, there are nicer beaches further down if that is important to you. Could do with a clean up as we found lots of plastic cups and bottles and straws from hotel guests. Considering the amount of wildlife think the hotel should care more about this and clean up the beaches regularly, not specific to this hotel as all should do this, however, it would be nice to know hotel cares about their environment especially when they are profiting off it.   Rooms-  Very specious, clean, nice flow, nice view.  Cleaned every day.   Check out-  Was easy, HOWEVER, we had our wrist bands immediately taken from us and told all inclusive finishes at 12pm even though our pick up wasn’t until 1:30 so any food or drink we would have to buy. This is especially annoying when we only arrived about 4/5 pm so really have not had a full 14 days all inclusive.   Overall, good holiday however would not return due to it not being a full all inclusive and if I was TUI I wouldn’t advertise it as an all inclusive holiday, I think this needs to be reconsidered as it is technically false advertising.  Although, you are on an all inclusive I would advise bringing a lot of money as everyone wants tipping, also it’s not really ALL inclusive.…",Responded 1 week ago,"Response from Rodolfo Pacheco, Director General at Sheraton Buganvilias Resort & Convention CenterResponded 1 week ago","Hi BakerHankin,   We appreciate the time that you have invested in writing an overview of your stay with us.

540,Starting to slip a little but still enjoyed ourselves,3,6,2022,LQGuy,"We visit Puerto Vallarta annually, and usually stay here or the Westin.  The Marriott usually lives up to the positive reviews, but for us, this time around (guessing our 6-7th visit?), it started off BAD!  Upon arrival May 28 at 5:30 PM, we tried dinner at Las Casitas and I ordered Sea Bass.  Sea Bass is usually mild, but this one had the most disgustingly strong fishy taste!  Not wanting to be a difficult guest, I just shared my husband's dinner and set mine to the side.  Six hours later, fever, cramps, and some disgusting details I'll omit from here rapidly set in.  Imodium didn't help, so had to pay for the hotel doctor to come and get antibiotics and one other prescription.  Took three days to get it under control...half of our vacation!  Not to mention feeling pretty miserable the entire time.  It is worth noting that for all the many years we visit Puerto Vallarta, we have never once become ill from water or food!    Upon return to the room after dinner, the soap dispenser in the shower was empty and we had to request more.  No big deal.  But an indication that details were not paid attention to.  During our entire one week stay, the TV was inoperable (didn't appear to be connected to satellite/cable, and the only function on the remote that worked was the power button.  Again, we did not complain about it as we did not fly to PV to watch TV!  Yet, quality improvement would suggest that room features would be routinely checked to be operable before the next guest arrives.  They were not here.  We noticed a large number of people at the pool, who are not hotel guests each day of our stay!  Marriott has resorted to selling ""day passes"" to non-hotel staying guests.  So despite the hotel being lower occupancy, that in no way guarantees the pool will not be packed!  And it was!  Further ""the towel game"" (where guests show up at 6AM to ""claim"" a lounge chair, and then don't show up until well after noon, if at all) is alive and well at the Marriott, with no discouragement from management to engage in this tacky behavior.    The music ""pumped in"" around the pool was generally a better choice than what often occurs in other resorts.  But then they bring in the speakers and play the generic ""club"" music loudly.  That's probably fun if you're in your 20s-40s and here to party, party, party.  For us, we just wanted a little peace and quiet to try to relax by.  We're not faulting anyone for that.  But if you're like us, the only escape from it is to go back to your room....not why most of us go on vacation!    The last area needing improvement is wi-fi connectivity.  The signal drops constantly!  As often as every 15 minutes, making streaming difficult!  Might not sound like a huge issue, except that to re-establish the connection, you have to go back in to settings, wait upwards of 5-15 minutes for the eventual log-in screen to reappear, and THEN can you reconnect (until the next disruption).  I don't think I've ever had this experience at another hotel.  And it wasn't just one device.  It happened daily to all four of our connected devices!  On the other side of the spectrum are the stand-outs!  Most all of the staff continue to be exceptionally friendly and helpful!  We continue to absolutely adore Reina in La Estancia and would bring her home with us if we could!!  Her warmth, personality, helpfulness is just outstanding and the Marriott is incredibly lucky to have her!  For breakfast, the same holds true for Andrea working in the omelet/waffle area.  She too is such a sweet lady, always helping my husband to properly pronounce his food requests in Spanish but in the most friendly, welcoming way possible, making learning some language a joy!  And like Reina, just a very nice person that you want to bring home with you if you could!    Also, despite Marriott stating on the website that maid service would only occur one to two times per week, we found that they were ready and eager to clean our room daily!  They always did a nice job with that too.    REMINDER:  Please be generous with tipping!  None of these people earn a living wage like we do.  Their livelihoods are dependent on tips!  And coming out of the pandemic, many of them bore huge financial burdens just to get through it.  Don't be stingy with showing appreciation when you get good service!  The room itself had been updated since our last visit and appeared to be modern and well equipped (minus inoperable TV).  The bed was comfortable enough (though we both had some problems sleeping).  The A/C in the room was flawless and kept the room very comfortable with no mechanical issues at all!    My only remaining complaint has to do with the bill.  And for some reason, I only experience this at the Marriott in PV!  Simply put, what is charged, does not mirror rates quoted!  Let me give an example so we're clear:  I was also please to review my folio and not find any extra charges or ""inflated"" ones (in the past, I would find a variety of charges that were not correct and appeared to be manually added.  NOT so this time, which was great!!)    The noise level inside the hotel hallways can be quite loud if guests are rude (which many are!)  It's essentially an echo chamber up/down the length of the building (which is an atrium style, so everything can be heard).  There's really not much that the hotel can do about rude guests.  It's astounding how many of them there are though!    With this experience, in totality, we are thinking that we will need to start trying other hotels in Puerto Vallarta.  Don't get me wrong!  This is NOT a dump.  The service is NOT horrible.  They will probably try to make things right if you tell them!  But some of these things (pool capacity, noise levels) are not things that bother everyone, and therefore not likely to change.  And of course, eating and getting sick, and losing half of your vacation stay to food poisoning is an expensive and pretty miserable experience!    For Management, if you elect to respond here, I would kindly request that you discontinue the practice of saying that you're going to ""make a plan"" or ""talk to the staff in that area"".  All of this is ""lip service"" and ""window dressing"".  Your avid TripAdvisor reviewers and readers know that things are being addressed when they stop reading the same areas of concern over and over.

Okimy provided lots of fun options of things to do and though we weren’t around that much, he went out of his way to remember our names and invite us to participate. Uvelda kept our rooms clean and provided anything that we needed. During this time of COVID it was reassuring to have her attention to keeping our room clean. There are new lounge chairs around the pool and Christopher was at his post handing out towels. The rooms are charming and all have ocean views.

The room was outdated and damp with chairs full of mould and the bathroom was wet because they turned off the AC... it was an awful welcome. and then the wifi would not connect....  I only stayed 2 nights and managed to make the most of it, as the staff is very friendly.  I got home and I realised that the hotel had charged me £205!!!  I called and they left me waiting for more than 30m until I gave up. I used the contact me option on their site and it gave me no acknowledgement reply, so I am not even sure I will be contacted!   I am disgusted by the way this was all conducted, scamming people to get a deal that does not really exist and charging everything separately! this is not the way reputable businesses should be operating.…",Responded 5 days ago,"Response from  , Propietario at Villa Del Palmar Beach Resort & SpaResponded 5 days ago","Dear Cristina,   I appreciate the time you took to share your experience with us.

574,25+ Years Staying At The Villa Del Palmar,4,6,2022,Laurie A,"First of all I'd like to say..""THANK YOU"" for the free WI-Fi.  It's about time.. AND much appreciated by those of us that have to work while on vacation.. As always..  we had an incredible trip to the resort.    Yadira was the sweetest and most efficient housekeeper.  She was absolutely AMAZING and met my every need. ❤  Francisco has been there it seems.. as long as I have been going there and I must say without a doubt..  he is by FAR my favorite waiter whether it be on the beach or poolside.  He is incredible and I hope he stays forever.  ❤  Have heard rumors of a few changes I'm not real happy about..  No towel hut?  REALLY??  Why can't umbrellas be put down at the beach anymore?  Why can't the people up at the palapa's have an extra umbrella for additional shade anymore?  Those are some of the things I would like to know..  Oh..  and one more thing.. I would NOT recommend the Sports Bar for eating unless you want to eat the signature  wings..  The chicken tenders were burned and the french fries were undercooked and  cold..   I feel like the management   is not looking out for the guests best interest.  Not sure if they are new.. but when I come back in December and the Canadians are there I fear they might chew them up and spit them out.  Here's to, I hope, many more years of travel there..

576,Absolutely horrible,1,6,2022,olga h,"Absolutely horrible!! I was wondering why this resort is so much cheaper compare to all other resorts since it looks so nice from the pictures and quickly found out once I tried to check in( while being there for almost 4 hours, I have seen others having same issue).The night before I got my confirmation number for the booking and everything was set. We arrived and they couldn’t find it for 30 something minutes. I finally called the place where booked it and they given them the same exact booking and miraculously it was found. Then they were saying that it wasn’t paid even while the representative has told them multiple times that it’s paid and confirmed by THEIR team. They then tell me that their booking team doesn’t work on Saturday so they can’t confirm it therefore I have to pay 250 dollars until they can confirm it. I was absolutely livid at this point because I’m pregnant and havnt eaten while trying to deal with all this mess. They ask me to come back at 3 and maybe it will be worked out then. So I was waiting at the hotel since 1 and didn’t get to go into my room until 4:30!! I still had to pay 250 dollars and they were trying to say I had to check out by 10 am even though my reservation said 11. The manager finally agreed to 11. I then found bunch of signs by the rooms saying check out is 11!! So they were trying to get us to leave an hour earlier after not even allowing to check in on time. Please just pay a little bit more money and stay at another resort.

584,Basically traveled to stay at a construction site,2,6,2022,Ella F,"I was overall pretty disappointed with our stay at hotel Mousai. I came in with very high expectations, I checked their reviews on every platform so for the price I was expecting a five star resort & experience.  The check in process was fast and easy everyone was relatively friendly our Butler Eduarto showed us to our room he was very knowledgeable and helpful. Our stay took a sharp turn for the worst when the first full day of our stay construction in the room right next to us began at 9 AM and went till 5 PM. I am talking about chainsaws and hammering literally every minute between that time period. I decided to not make it a big deal the first day and we spent our entire day on the rooftop pool which was awesome. However, the next two days it was raining so we wanted to spend some relaxing time on our balcony in our Jacuzzi which was quite literally impossible with a jackhammer and chainsaw going off in the room next to us so I decided to get in contact with the hotel supervisor Orlando. He was extremely rude and unhelpful… He also lied to me about what was to be done about our bill. What really bothered me was that he acted like I was inconveniencing them… I paid 700+ dollars a night for premium service and the ultra room. I had to bargain and beg for something to be done until he finally said that he would erase the balance that we had which wasn’t even a lot was under $200 and he pointed out that he would have the Wagu removed from her Roshi that we had which may be equaled out to $20. After not really getting anywhere… I basically just had to agree to this not sufficing accommodation. Not to mention it was my birthday. I felt like after that everyone at the front desk was pretty rude to us. Treating us like we were crazy. The only reason I’m giving two stars is because the men at the rooftop were amazing and very helpful and attentive the drinks were great on the rooftop all of the stuff on the rooftop deserves a five star review they were truly amazing. But overall that alone wasn’t enough to make our stay feel worth it. When you travel you travel for relaxation and peace of mind if I wanted to stay on a construction site I would’ve just went to LA. So for anyone reading this review just know that when you book with hotel Messiah there’s a 50-50 chance that you are going to be in a room right next to construction and that management will do literally nothing about it. I would definitely not pay extra for any type of premium service it is absolutely not worth it.…",Responded yesterday,"Response from Imelda Zermeño, Atención al huésped/Recepción at Hotel MousaiResponded yesterday","Dear Ellefairon,   Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at Hotel Mousai.

586,"Very good, not great!",4,6,2022,Kamaaina22,"We had very high expectations for this hotel as they tout being a five star hotel. We have travelled all over the world in various levels of properties, mostly 4-5 star properties. While it was a very nice hotel, it was by no means perfect or at the level of a 5 star hotel, hence the 4 rating. Let’s start with the positives, because there were many.  The lobby is beautiful and check in was smooth. We had an ultra Mousai suite and we’re on the top floor with amazing views of the bay and Los Arcos in the distance. A jacuzzi on a huge deck with a hammock. Our suite came with a butler. Ok what do you need a butler for? Let me tell you…our Butler was Lillian and she was absolutely delightful! You will get his or her cell phone to text for dinner reservations, spa appointments, needing a different pillow, etc. Lilly was the constant that made our stay enjoyable and we were so fortunate to have had her and I can’t give her higher praise. She’s 5 star all the way!  The roof top pool is the most amazing pool experience you’ll ever have! You get off the elevator and a pool concierge is there to great you and show you to you chairs. Most days it was Yessinia who was warm and friendly and welcomed us back many times. The views at the pool are amazing with the pool blending into the bay perfectly! The service at the pool was amazing. Diego, Ricardo, Juan and all the servers took great care of us and our drinks full! We never had difficulty getting a chair and we’re ready with towels and the best umbrellas providing shade throughout the day. Use your towel, someone will bring you a new one! Five star! I also have to add the food was fantastic too! Never had a bad lunch there and the coconut shrimp are great! We loved our time at the South Tower Rooftop Pool!  Food: The food was definitely a step above at most restaurants we ate at. The best by far was Bocados, The steakhouse. Our server both times was Daniel, who was awesome, friendly and very knowledgeable! We enjoyed our meals with him as our waiter very much! Second was Dao, the Chinese food restaurant, it was also very good and our server Horacio was very good! Japanese was Hiroshi and it was very good too with great views.  Now for the cons:   The hotel is on a steep hill which makes walking down to the beach, or off-site restaurants like Bocados difficult. They have these cute trolley’s which on the cobble stone roads and wood benches not very comfortable. We went down to the beach once and it took like 20 minutes. We like to take a walk on the beach a few times and that’s not practical, so I found myself getting a little stir crazy as it was up to the pool, back to our room, off to dinner. Back to our room as there was little to no entertainment in the evenings. We’re not big partiers, but some live music while having a couple drinks is fun.  Noi the Italian restaurant for us had very slow service and few options for dinner. We had a terrible dinner there on our second night and we soured us! 2 star!  The Spa is on the 11th floor of the North Tower so has amazing views and limited space. We had paid for a relaxation couples massage before we arrived and it was not very relaxing. Seems the walls of the treatment rooms are not very sound proof and hearing women scream every 5 minutes when in the hydrotherapy cold shower, was very distracting! Haydee to Spa supervisor did follow up with us about our experience and made it right, but would rather have had the relaxing experience! 4 star  One night (1 am) the fire alarm went off for about 10 minutes. Being on the top floor, I was very concerned. Stuck my nose outside to sniff for smoke. Was this a false alarm or a real concern? Alarm just stops about 5-10 minutes later. No call, no message on the iPad, nothing. Good luck falling back asleep after that! 2 star  Our jacuzzi tub on our deck was wonderful to have. We used it everyday for as long as we could tolerate the heat. It wouldn’t stay at the temp we set it too. It kept going up above 103-105 when the jets were on. We had service guys in our room 3 separate times and it never got fixed! 2 star  Overall we enjoyed our stay at Mousai. The food, room and service was mostly very good to excellent. Not sure we’ll return, especially for the normal rates they charge. Had too many disappointments to be 5 star for us.…",Responded 2 days ago,"Response from Imelda Zermeño, Atención al huésped/Recepción at Hotel MousaiResponded 2 days ago","Dear Kamaaina22,  Thank you for your comment, your feedback is very valuable for us, and we will take a closer look at it.

590,DON'T THINK TWICE,5,6,2022,Riley M,"WOW. I have truly never experienced this level of hospitality. My husband and I came to Hotel Mousai for our honeymoon May 16-23 -- it was our first time in PV, but 3rd time in Mexico (Cabo + Cancun). We stayed in the Ultra Suite in the North Tower w/ Carlos as our butler... from the minute we arrived to the minute we departed we felt right at home.   The spa's hydrotherapy was included in our package and we did it daily - I swear, we never missed a day. It was phenomenal + we highly, highly recommend checking out the spa at least once during your stay. The staff is fabulous, the views are incredible, and our 80-min massage was one of our trip highlights.   After the spa we spent the entire rest of the day... every single day... at the rooftop pool. WHY would you ever leave?! Our MVP staff consisted of Jorge, Ricardo, Alejandro, Carlos, Juan and Marcelino (if I forgot anyone I am so sorry - those are the names I wrote down as INCREDIBLE). When I tell you they are on top of their stuff, they are ON TOP OF IT. Never did I go empty handed or without a drink. They even brought us a 'Happy Honeymoon' dessert tray one day out of the blue. You seriously feel like family with them and I hope they remember me next year when we go back - hah!   After the pool we went to one of the included (in all inclusive) restaurants. Sushi, steakhouse and Mexican food were our favorites. I could go on and on about the food, but all you need to know is that food is usually subpar at all inclusives and it is WONDERFUL here.   Needless to say, we will be back. Every single year.

602,Beautiful hotel...,3,5,2022,Ynlvr,"Beautiful hotel with less than 200 rooms. Perfect size for tranquility after enjoying the lucky DJ at the pool. Well appointed and spacious rooms with a modern appeal. GREAT shower!!! Plenty of outlets and USB ports throughout the room. Very good internet service. Excellent housekeeping staff service. Lovely pool area. Good bar staff. Great views from the rooftop and our private balcony.   This is a perfect do it yourself hotel. Below standard service/hospitality elsewhere. I had low service standards after visiting for lunch in the restaurant/bar on lobby level where I waited for service before and after ordering. Ordered room service often but not available for breakfast. One evening, I was handed my uncovered room service order at the door, without utensils.   Preparing for departure, I asked for a Covid test appointment. Nothing offered, not even a referral for a testing facility to come to the hotel or you to them. The response was “there is a clinic across the street.” Stepped outside and there were trees across the street. We took a taxi and went to three locations before finding one to administer the test. I had our results before returning to the hotel with no assistance from the staff.   With all of the great amenities and esthetics, the service was a disappointment.…","Responded May 7, 2022","Response from  , Propietario at Hotel Mio VallartaResponded May 7, 2022","Thank you for your review and your visit, certainly we have the testing facilities to come a doctor, we will review why the suggestion was not given to you, and we will  improve the room service"

619,Trip saved!,4,6,2022,Kirsty T,"I wrote previously when we were halfway through our stay at Dreams, but this is an updated review.)  I’d really struggled with lack of options for vegetarians (e.g one night I was served a dish with seafood hidden in it despite explicitly asking for it to be made vegetarian), which had led to the previous review. After the review, Moncerath did an amazing job to ensure that there was always an interesting vegetarian option at the restaurants. She was a real star and saving grace and made the holiday much better. Sucks to complain but glad we did sooner so that it could be sorted!   The pool and restaurant waiting staff, and Coco Cafe staff at this hotel are fantastic. The entertainment staff were so lovely - special shout out to Beatriz because she made our day on multiple occasions!   Food: after Monce’s help with organising vegetarian meals I genuinely could not fault the food I had at the restaurants, as it was all lovely and interesting. We both became quickly bored with the buffet restaurant’s offering though - I don’t think this is a fault with the hotel, but they seem more catered towards Americans on short breaks than to Brits on a 2-week holiday.  Location: The hotel is in a good location - not far from the airport (but far enough), close to puerto magico for day trips, and close to the old town. The concierge staff make is super simple to get a taxi anywhere you need to be.   Hotel: the rooms are nicely decorated with decent views of the ocean (even on the 2nd floor). There are a LOT of weddings, which is understandable with the location, but it does take away from your enjoyment of the facilities as they are not held in a private section of the hotel. Almost daily weddings and private events meant that sections of the beach, poolside area, bars and restaurants were closed off to guests. Not my cup of tea but if this doesn’t bother you, you should be fine.  Overall we had a good trip and would consider staying at a Dreams resort in the future.…",Responded 6 days ago,"Response from Alejandra Geyer, Otro at Dreams Vallarta Bay Resort & SpaResponded 6 days ago","Dear, kirstyt895.

627,Great value family vacation,4,5,2022,Kacie V,"I travelled with a family of 7. My husband, me, 4 kids aged 6-14 and my grandmother. We stayed May7th-May 14th 2022, in a 3 bedroom, 3 bathroom villa.  Restaurants: I read reviews prior to my trip about not getting restaurant reservations. Upon check-in I took a picture of the restaurant reservation QR code and every morning at 9am my husband would use his phone to scan the code off of my phone. We were able to get reservations every night we wanted to. The first night we arrived late and didn't get to the buffet until 9:30 pm. it was a pretty normal variety of foods. My favorite for the dinner buffet was the cook to order station-an employee literally prepared fresh meat and cooked on the grill right in front of you (the pork and pineapple tacos were amazing).  Favorite part of the morning buffet was the cooked to order omelet station. They also had traditional breakfast foods like french toast, pancakes, chilequiles, potatoes, fresh fruit, yogurt, etc. The second night we ate at Fujiyama (Japanese)-favorite choices there were the tepenyaki and the fried banana dessert. The third night we ate at La Piazza(Italian)-favorite choices there were the beef main dish and panna cotta. The fourth night we at the French restaurant-favorite choices were seafood bouillabaisse and the vanilla crème brulee. As part of our reservation (I booked through RCI) we also had access to the 3 restaurants on the adults only side of the resort. The fifth night we ate at Paradise(Mediterranean food)-favorite choices were raincoat shrimp and the red wine pears with vanilla ice-cream. The sixth night we ate at the Mexican restaurant (also on the adult only side)-favorite choices there were cheese tortitas, mole sampler plate and chocolate cake. The seventh night we did the Puerto Vallarta pirate ship and ate dinner on the boat instead of at the resort.  Miguel Angel at the concierge desk was awesome and went out of his way to help with our needs.  The resort offers kids club which we took advantage of when we wanted a day out of the sun. My 3 girls aged 6, 8, & 10 went to the kids club on Mexican mother's day (May 10th). They stayed the whole day and made arts and crafts. They worked on a mother's day card, created paper flowers, made a molded ceramic hand print and painted it (I'll add a pic) and took pictures with a photo prop. They also created bracelets out of beads and decorated sugar cookies with icing. The ladies working the kids club were awesome. We did not use the jetix club because it only opened after 6 pm and had more of a bar type feel than a place for kids to hang out and play video games. I wish the jetix club was open during the daytime so we could have more activities during the hottest parts of the day.  Our villa had 3 bedrooms, 1 room had a king size bed, and the other 2 rooms had 2 double beds each, for a total of 5 beds. We also had 3 bathrooms (with showers), a kitchen, living room, dining room, and patio balcony. We were on the 4th floor. We did not utilize the kitchen. I brought my laptop for work and was surprised that the hotel wifi was actually better than the travel wifi I paid for. The villa was dated but it was huge and clean. A man came to our villa everyday and restocked our fridge with pepsi, diet pepsi, 7up, modelo, and bottled water.   The nightly shows were a treat to watch after dinner at Club Nitro. You could tell a lot of work went in to choreography and the entertainment experience, but our favorite by far was the Michael Jackson show. The shows are everyday at 9 pm except for Saturday which was at 8:30 pm.  Over the main pool was a zipline for kids which was open everyday for about an hour and a half. My daughters enjoyed it. The kids pirate ship waterpark was too shallow for my girls so they spent most of their time in the bigger pools. My grandmother spent her time in the adults only pool which had shade and a swim up bar.  My only complaint is that some of the wheelchair ramps were steep and a bit dangerous for my grandmother and her walker.…",Responded 3 weeks ago,"Response from Crown Paradise All Inclusive Resort, Director General at Crown Paradise Club Puerto VallartaResponded 3 weeks ago","Dear guest  We appreciate your time to share your experience at Crown Paradise Club Puerto Vallarta.

At first, we were a little worried about the location since we read about it being up on a hill but the views were absolutely worth it and we really loved the peace and quiet up there. It was so easy to get a cab to the beach (5 min drive) or Zona Romantica (10min drive) and it only cost us $3-5 USD per ride. The food was excellent and we loved the breakfast buffet. The room and balcony were spacious and clean. The staff was so welcoming, especially Alberto who was kind enough to let me practice my Spanish.

A lot of positives about Miramar. 3 minute/ $3 taxi to Beach or town. Taxi/ Ubers very cheap here. You’re really here for the views & the service. Food also was terrific. I had lowest category room and it was still awesome. Separate bedroom, amazing view and huge. Traveled with young son and he did not want to leave the free “kids club.” Several pools, main one good for families, rooftop pool good for couples. Rooftop pool is unlike anything I’ve seen before. Views of the world, which becomes a restaurant in evening. About 30 minutes/15 Uber from the airport. Best value for the dollar hotel I’ve ever experienced.

632,Beautiful views and amazing staff,4,4,2022,Tichia S,"This hotel is quant with beautiful views! We arrived in PV with a reservation at a VRBO and when we arrived they wouldn’t let us in because they said they didn’t take 3 day reservations. So we had to scramble with our 3 teen daughters in tow to find a place for our first 3 days in PV. I found this and we got a 3 bedroom, 3 bath suite. It was literally perfect for all of us. The resort is super chill, very quiet without many ppl. We typically stay in big places but this was a very nice change of pace. The spa is nice with very reasonable prices. All of the staff were accommodating and just genuinely good ppl. If we ever return to PV, GM will be at the top of our list.  Tips to note- it sits high in the hills which is why it has amazing views but no beach access. It’s a 10 minute drive to the Romantic zone or we took 30 minute to walk down hill to the closet beach. My husband refused to walk back up hill so we got a cap for $5 back to the resort.…","Responded Apr 27, 2022","Response from Jesús  Arellano, Atención al huésped/Recepción at Grand Miramar All Luxury Suites & ResidencesResponded Apr 27, 2022","Thank you for your comments, we are glad to know about your great time at Gand Miramar."

The hotel location is perfect - its an easy walk to the Malecon, it has a great beach, food and drinks are excellent and there are many resturants and taco stands within a few minutes walking.  It's the staff that really makes a difference. I personally can't say enough about the staff - Javier (our fav), Aurelio, Enrique, Edson at the pool - Marianna, Liz and Tammy are the best concierge- restaurant staff (Cesar) is great, front desk staff (Dario) always so accommodating .  The hotel itself is amazing with a gorgeous pool area and the beach is on the very end of the public beach so we could go on walks down the beach and people watch. The sunsets from the the pool bar/deck or the room balcony were especially stunning every night,  We love getting our food and drinks delivered to our beach chairs, and really enjoyed the lunch options especially Enrique's specialties.

The entire hotel is spotlessly clean and well maintained, they have different activities everyday that keep you entertained. While I was there they had live music and dancer one day and a beautiful little stand full of local candy for you to try, another. The bar staff at the pool bar were so friendly and I loved talking and joking with them everyday. The front desk staff are so friendly and welcoming and gave us great recommendations on where to eat outside of the hotel. The wait staff at La Ceiba (the hotel restaurant) was great and attentive and one of the waiters would also make jokes with us when delivering our food that always made me laugh and made our whole experience better. Even the room cleaning staff would go above and beyond and make sure to make you feel welcomed.

657,"Looked great on paper, but missed on some keys aspects",3,5,2022,f27bx22ewq,"Decent facility for accomodation. Rooms were spacious, but the coffee bar was cramped on the mantel below the TV. The USB charging ports were a thoughtful addition to the mains outlets.   Entertainment activities were decent and the staff was cheerful and helpful.   Gym is small, but nicely appointed with latest equipment and Gustavo the gym trainer/attendant was the friendliest and nicest person I encountered.   The bars don't offer any snacks or even options for ordering food at the bar. Drinks are watered down and weak. Only 2 options for beer drinkers - Does Equis and Dos Equis Dark. Which isn't terrible a thing, to be honest. Dos Equis is pretty good. Even if you order a specific branded liquor for drinks, I observed that the bartenders were mixing them down with the house brands.   Beach location is great and the pools are decent, however, the pools could use some decorative features underwater if only to mark the steps around the swim-up bar and/or some relief from the unbroken light blue color on the bottom and pool walls.   Which brings me to the food. Buffet is terrible for lunch and dinner. It seemed they were serving reheated food from previous day or previous meal at the buffet. Most of the food didn't have any signs and some of it was unrecognizable. Avoid the scrambled eggs, and the mashed potatoes. Grilled chicken was decent the first time it was served in the buffet. Subsequently, the same batch of grilled chicken was featured in the next meal and the following meal (but in mole sauce) - which deserves some recognition for creativity in food recycling/re-serving (Haha!). Chilaquiles in the buffet had little crystalline rocks that would have broken my teeth, but fortunately I have implants  which were able to withstand the surprise addition to chilaquiles without a spontaneous scream erupting from my lungs. This happened on at least 2 different days.   Avoid eating here -  if you must stay here.   I enjoyed meeting other guests at the hotel and the funtastic team is great at what it does.   Expect a bit of a language barrier at the hotel. Most of the staff is decent at english, but many staff members aren't and it can be a challenge to communicate with them.   Grand Park Royal PV telephone service is probably the weakest aspect among their hospitality staff, that includes both on property (room service, housekeeping) and off property (requesting information or changes before traveling) - if you don't know Spanish. …",Responded 2 weeks ago,"Response from Park Royal Pv, Atención al huésped/Recepción at Grand Park Royal Puerto VallartaResponded 2 weeks ago","Dear f27bx22ewq:  First, we want to express our gratitude for your recent stayed at Grand Park Royal Puerto Vallarta and for your valuable time to sharin us this review where highlight the pros and cons you experienced, as it will allow us to improve our services.

658,Wedding  fiesta hotel hell,1,5,2022,Ed D,"CAUTION STAY AWAY.  This was our second hotel that we were move to  from West jet Tours . The first one was such a dump they had to move us after we threatened to sue .This place was clean well maintained but that's the list of positives . There was a loud wedding every second day that went till 11pm but continued on  the beach till 4 or 5 am .When you called to complain about the noise they would just say they are looking into it ,,,but will do nothing . The Food was a joke . most of it was either burnt or un eatable . When you complained to front desk about the food or the lack of it ,they would just give you a sower look and say they will tell the manager . Never did we get a sorry or how can we make it up to you. Room services would always be over a hour and burn whatever you ordered . I think they did this on purpose to discourage ordering room services . I had to always ask 3 times for anything for the room, room services,room cleaning,bare to be restocked, laundry services. Laundry services  was a complete rip off. I could have my laundry done for a month for what they charged us for 2 small bags of laundry . the beach front looked nice but it was unusable . The sand was almost a 45 Degree slope to the water .The waves were so strong they would knock you  down . No life guard on duty at any pool . If you came here for a relaxing vacation you cam to the wrong place . If the Wedding noise from the concert speakers did'nt rattle you out of your bed then the loud surf and crashing waves will .  The windows are all single pain We were told by hotel workers this is a place for locals and weddings not for Canadians or Americans looking for a vacation. One worker told us to rent house next time ,its cheaper and quiet .…",Responded 3 weeks ago,"Response from Park Royal Pv, Atención al huésped/Recepción at Grand Park Royal Puerto VallartaResponded 3 weeks ago","Dear Guest EddW7726LF:  Thank you very much for your preference and for your review, we were pleasured to welcome you at Grand Park Royal Puerto Vallarta.

663,NEVER COME FOR A BUSINESS TRIP,1,1,2020,MariferB,"This hotel may be recently remodeled but they have to do an urgent PERSONNEL CHANGE, no one has a “can do” or “help you” attitude. When one travels for business, things can’t wait until 9 or 10am that supervisors come in to get things fixed. Came for one night as I had an early morning meeting. Ordered “room service” with a pre-order sheet (see picture so you don’t even bother filling it in) they give you to be delivered at 7am... NO ONE BOTHERED to even pick up the request from my door! My reservation had breakfast included, I asked if this included the in-room one and they said yes. In the morning they said no, I tried to change my reservation to “no breakfast included” and was told I had to wait for the manager to arrive. Plus, I NEVER had WIFI, it just doesn’t connect, and when you call, guess what? You also have to wait for the IT person to come in the next day to fix it (of course I am checking out now and the IT guy isn’t here yet)…","Responded Mar 6, 2020","Response from FRANCISCO  VIERA BARRAGAN, Director General at Hotel LaffayetteResponded Mar 6, 2020",Agradecemos sus comentarios

Our first night we had a dog barking continuously ALL night, barking, crying whimpering.  I could not sleep, so at 3 am I went out to investigate.  I refrained from calling the front desk, as I didn't want to wake my husband.  Had no idea where the reception was so I went back to my room.  Locked out!  So ended up having to knock on the door several times to wake my husband.  We called the front desk, spoke to security, they were going to investigate.  Long story short, the dog barked for 11 hrs straight.  It was heart breaking to hear this.  Spoke to security several times and the front desk.  They moved us to another room, but I am still upset as this must be an ongoing thing.  The dog wasn't inside someones home or I wouldn't hear it so loudly.

670,Yikes,1,2,2020,Larry F,"This is an overrated hotel on a hill. The noise of the trucks shifting down will rattle you awake at night. No elevator, the rooms are spacious, the linen worn but clean and the whole place was dingy. Marked up walls, marred doors, the grout was blackened, the mirror cracked and no AC. The staff are helpful and welcoming but it did little to counter the poor lodging. The pool was out of commission and the bar closed and very few guests were in evidence. I think it is common sense to upgrade your guests to the best rooms available when there are very few people there.

688,"Pleasant modern hotel, near historic district",4,5,2019,Travelbling,"I stayed here in early April of 2019, Friday through Sunday.  I really enjoyed my stay here.  Positives: very helpful staff; convenient and plentiful breakfast buffet; cool and modern room decor; recently renovated building, so the rooms seem new-ish; location convenient to the downtown historical district, just a few long blocks away; excellent shower and water pressure for that.  The staff were very welcoming, especially Luis on the day shift, who helped us book a couple of interesting tours in and around Guadalajara.  My only peeves about the room were that there are no drawers to put your clothes in, and the lock on the door was not high quality, and a little tricky to lock from inside, until you figure it out, and there is zero counter space in the bathroom.   Other than that, the room was fine.  It was a junior suite that faced the front of the hotel, the side with the bus stop out front.  Since we had the A/C on and the windows closed the whole time, I did not really notice much in the way of noise from the street, though I see other travelers here have mentioned it.  The neighborhood is not the best, or prettiest, but I would not let that be a reason not to stay here.  The hotel has a lot of good points, and we felt welcome and well-treated the whole time we were there.

690,Excellent location in the historic center,4,3,2019,KCtraveler1102,"The entire staff was very friendly & efficient. My room was always clean & well attended. I found the breakfast buffet a little underwhelming, but contained all the basics; breakfast staff went out of their way to get me hot milk for my coffee daily for 7days. I suggest an inside room on an upper floor as the hotel is shaped in a 'V' and both side streets are heavily traveled with buses; in 8 days/7 nights, I only heard the buses on 1 occasion-I was in an inside room on the 5th floor.

I lost count at 30 long black hairs on the tile floor, plus there were various other bits of fuzz and dust on the floor as well.  I called reception, and they sent a woman up from housekeeping.  I showed her how dirty the floor was, and she asked me if I wanted it cleaned.  I told her that I would prefer another room, as I didn't really want to wait around while they cleaned.  She left, and about 15 minutes later the bell hop was back to take me to another room.  Surprise, surprise - the floor was dirty in this room, too!!!  I went back to reception and waited half an hour while they cleaned the second room.  Luckily, it was truly clean after this, but the room safe was locked shut, and I had to get someone to come up and open it.  There were no blankets in the rooms, the beds were quite firm, and the pillows were hard.  I can live with all this, but there is no excuse for dirty floors.

696,Great location and staff,4,5,2017,yiwenfrsingapore,"What I liked: Location, good service, good breakfast, cleanliness, price.  What I did not like: The blanket is bedsheet thin, wifi terrible  The macrobus is just across the next street. Though I do not know any Spanish, the staff kindly wrote down the stations for me to get on and off in order to get to the zoo. It would have cost 100pesos to take a taxi. Instead, I paid 7pesos. Also, Lucha libre is 10mins walk away from this hotel, so it was rather convenient for me to walk over to the arena on Sunday night. The shower is my favourite part of the room and the soap provided smells really good. I also enjoyed using the gym at level1.

Has a spacious parking building right across the street and it's free. The personnel is mostly attentive (special mention to front desk, bellboys and parking lot). Kudos for refilling free water bottles daily, but perhaps a water filter to refill bottles is more sustainable. The room we stayed in was comfortable and fairly clean but is small and felt a little crammed.  The WC had an internal leak and made noises as the water filled randomly (annoying at night). The coffee maker a cup were dirty and need replacing. Hot water was hit or miss, one day there was no hot water at all. We were four but only two towels were left in the room, I asked for 2 additional ones and got them but the clerk was visibly annoyed with my petition (never got pool towels because apparently they were being washed at all times, so I guess there was a towel shortage)  La Cevichería is listed a good place…","Responded Jan 6, 2022","Response from Daniel Sanchez Ornelas, Director General at Emporio VeracruzResponded Jan 6, 2022","Buenos días carloscajina!

700,Very disappointing,3,11,2021,SLSteve,"This property was probably really nice before COVID, and may be nice again. However, I can't recommend it as a place to stay now.  My booking confirmation highlighted all of these features (with commentary):  Exclusive access to the Executive Lounge floor, where guest can enjoy an American breakfast and a wide variety of snacks throughout the day and with a reading area (nope, closed UFN).  Access to Sky Lounge (Nope) LCD flat screen TV (Small) Cable TV (Complete with snowy picture on almost all channels). Electronic in-room safe (Yes, but it's not bolted down. So put everything in here and then it can all be stolen at once). Scale (Yes) Coffee maker (Yes, but only first day's coffee is included) Alarm clock with iPod connectivity (if your iPod was manufactured in 2007) Minibar (Nope) Air conditioning with climate control (Yes) Refrigerator (not plugged in or inoperative) More stuff... not worth discussing.  Our room had two double beds, but was only stocked with one bath towel, one coffee cup, and one glass. I guess the target customer is alone but wants to sleep in a different bed on alternating nights.  The whole hotel felt run down. Toilet ran unless you jiggled the handle just right. Drawer knobs loose. No maintenance seems to be happening.  I will say that the staff were friendly and helpful, it's a great location, and they did have a breakfast in the restaurant to replace the lounge breakfast.  Like I said, check into it in a year or two, but for now I'd avoid it.…","Responded Dec 2, 2021","Response from Daniel Sanchez Ornelas, Director General at Emporio VeracruzResponded Dec 2, 2021","Hello SLSteve!

Late check-out was somehow ‘forgotten’ (even though we confirmed this two days prior).   The room was ok, but the shower had broken tiles and mold. While there may have been room service, no menu, card or further info was placed in the room.   Hotel organized airport transfer was priced wrongly (payment only at airport, thus too late).  The breakfast buffet looked ok, but was not ‘continental’, however the coffee was unsavory  and the milk we were served had gone bad (!).   Sanitation measures seemed ok.

This Doubletree was horrible.  After a long flight my check in was a check out. I was charged for all my stay at once. No greetings no thanking for being Diamond. Absolutely nothing. Cold careless cut service lacking people. Was given an “upgrade” and handed my keys. No indication of the elevator, no breakfast information just plain nothing. I asked for everything making them aware of the bad CS. They didn’t care. Guess what.. my room keys didn’t work so deon I go back to get it fixed. Then one of them went up with me to open the room. Room was tired and falling apart the door lock was non existent. I fell insecure. I let them know n did nothing. No mini fridge for my meds and when requested one was told they didn’t have any. After explaining my meds they brought one. Next day at breakfast I asked for a coke and charged it to the room. I leave and 5 minutes after the server knocking on my door demanding payment for the coke as I didn’t have an open card for incidentals. Went down and the same person just stared at me and was literally wait for the miserable coke to be paid. I said I didn’t understand why she had not kept a deposit. That’s protocol everywhere. Manager came n apologize n said that as a gesture of appreciation the next day breakfast was on him. That was a slap on my face. I’m a Diamond n breakfast is included. Then he said “oh that’s true”so gesture ends there. Nothing else to replace breakfast. What a disrespect! Then in the evening at the pool I asked for 2 Long Island iced teas and the server  tells me the price first to make sure I would pay that amount. Another slap. I pay n eat what I want regardless of cost.

718,Sitting on the dock of the bay,4,3,2019,16jamesdoc,"The construction is a bit unusual with a newer wing tacked on to the older one, but my room was excellent apart from a shortage of natural light.

Breakfast is additional but good; they also do decent dinners although the restaurant is a bit short on atmosphere.  All the staff are efficient and professional.  The location is about 10 minutes walk from the main action on the Zocalo but the hotel is right next to the port area so you can have your Otis Redding moment.

735,"Good Location, Friendly staff, but Needs  Updating",4,2,2020,MichiganPilot,"Stayed 14 days as American tourists in a beach front Mexican business oriented hotel.  With our limited Spanish and their English we communicated very nicely.  Very quiet and relaxing. Public areas of the hotel were immaculate.  Choose to include the breakfast buffet when you reserve the room.  The buffet was great and their drinks and other meals were also good.  The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is walking distance to many restaurants, a couple of casinos, and even a nightclub.  The neighborhood is safe.  There are many walkers, bikers and exercise enthusiasts along the walkway and public beaches.  Since we stayed for 14 days, the hotel gave us a frig., bottled water, and daily coffee packets au gratis.  The room had a great ocean view and was cleaned daily. (Make sure window tracts are cleaned and painted) The sink countertop was cracked and tub old but clean. Furniture was nice.  The hotel is 20 years old and salt water has a toll on everything.  Maintenance of painting the hotel, painting the wood posts in the pool area and the pool area itself is needed.  A hotel concierge would be nice to arrange tours but we used Trip Advisor/Viator and our English speaking tours went well.

First we were told we had to check in before getting help unloading our luggage, then there was a huge lineup for check in that took over a half hour to get through. I had requested a rollaway bed and they didn't even look into it, I reminded the person at the desk and he said he needed to check if they had any left but he never confirmed and we didn't get one. Then we got to our room and found it very run down, the terrace was actually all cracked it made us nervous to lean on it. The fixtures looked old, the phone would not work unless you tried hanging up and picking up at least 10 times. And if you actually got through to someone they would just ignore our requests, I asked for them to bring us a spoon no one ever came and on the second night there was a party and it was midnight and it was so loud we didn't sleep... I called to complain and they didn't care. Food was mediocre so we didn't eat there more than once.

The in-house restaurant offers a good array of Mexican and international dishes too.   The beachside pool is lovely, although unfortunately the swim-up bar was closed during my stay. The buffet breakfast is great too although not included in the room price - it would have been nice if this had been explained upfront.   Other than that though I have no complaints about this hotel - great value for money, good location in the upmarket south part of Veracruz and on a long boulevard with wide pedestrian paths perfect for jogging or roller-blading - which a lot of people do.

743,Pretty Average ,3,1,2018,Dukesteer,"Because Trip Adviser doesn’t offer 3.5 stars as an option, I have to go with a 3.  There’s nothing wrong with this property, but it feels dated, and shows wear. In the room, the toilet seat was crooked, some of the plaster had been repaired, and there was no way to leave just the inside bathroom light on. The AC is a floor/wall unit so you’re either warm, or dealing with cold air blasts which is certainly not healthy. The middle drawer in the chest wouldn’t stay closed so we had to pry in a note pad or risk hitting the fully open drawer at night. There was a white plastic chair on the balcony that was probably 10 years old. It was very dirty. Then there were the pillows...hard. We just couldn’t find any that were close to being soft.   On the plus side, our maid, Dalia, was about as good as it gets. She was very accommodating and she left us very nice notes every day. That was a nice touch.   The staff was nice and we very much enjoyed the restaurant, where the food was very good, as was the service. And finally, the location was quite good, along the beach and within walking distance of restaurants and sights.

757,Should be a good hotel,2,4,2019,geoffsab,"The good.  This is a new hotel in a great location that is in walking distance to a new mall and a 5 minute taxi ride to the airport. The rooms are spacious with comfortable beds, soft pillows, and cold air conditioning .   We selected this hotel for several reasons. We had an early flight the next morning and needed to be close to the airport. The hotel also advertises free transport to the airport.   Check-in.  When we checked in we double checked with the front desk about the transportation to the airport. We were told that the transport van was in the shop being repaired, but if we phone the front desk in the morning the hotel will call us a taxi and the hotel would pay for the taxi ride. Excellent.   The bad.  Lights out and early to bed so we can catch that early flight! Nope. At a little after 10pm the hotel checked in a family to the room next to ours. The family was not just loud, they were LOUD. They were talking, laughing, and then they turned on the tv with the volume loud enough for us to hear their action movie. The problem was amplified by the fact that there are shared doors that can open to the adjacent rooms. These shared doors are hollow-core with no casing on the hinge side and no sill threshold. This allows for easy sound transmission through the door and light transmission underneath and along the hinge side of the door. I knocked on the door at 11:30 as the action movies and talking continued. Volume went up. Called the front desk. Heard the phone ring next door and the following argument that ensued between the man next door and the front desk. The movies must have went on until 1am.   Woke up after 3 hours of sleep. Called front desk to order taxi. Go down to check out. Front desk says that hotel with only pay for taxi rides after 7am. Awesome.   So basically we got very little rest, a noisy room, and we ended up paying 200 pesos for our 5 minute taxi ride. I’m coming back to Veracruz, but I’m not staying here again.  …","Responded Apr 8, 2019","Response from AlejandraC2809, Gerente at Hotel Yes Inn Nuevo VeracruzResponded Apr 8, 2019","Dear Guest Thank you for the comments, we´re sorry for the inconviniences. Transportation to the airport is subject to availability, it is true that the van is in repair, we regret not being able to cover with your request. A taxi service works with established rates to avoid differences in prices, at reception they request.  Due to the noise of the room next door, I beg you to accept our sincere apologies, it was a reason for immediate room change so that you could rest. Rest assured that we will work on improving this.

I have stayed there at least 7 times over the years and the Hotel Delfines was build and is run as a 3 star.     Rooms are simple, clean, with either ceiling fans or with AC and ceiling fans.  And when I say clean, I really mean it. The entire hotel is cared for with expert hands.     About two blocks from the Veracruz Aquarium and beach area, a few real good restaurants, a bunch of tourist palapa restaurants, and a real fun place to spend some time. Boat trips to the Isla de Sacrifices and the coral reefs are a ten minute walk away. I have to recommend that @ 150 pesos a person for  about 2 1/2 to 3 hours a trip.   Back to the Hotel Delfines. Off street parking is offered but it fills up quickly. I always use public transportation in Veracruz because it is really pretty cheap.  Delfines has  started offering a free breakfast buffet. I used it the first day and was unimpressed. It would be fine for early risers to grab a coffee and some small pastry while waiting for the slower people to get up and moving. Then head to the Aquarium complex and have breakfast at VIPS.

The view from the balcony was nice but nothing extraordinary. it doesn't have a beachfront because across the street is the Navy School. This turned out to be a problem because the school band plays music at 7 am on Satudays (probably every weekday) and around 8 am on Sundays.  The rooftop pool looked very old.

The coupons for breakfast for us should always be ""americano"" not ""continental"" but we were always given the wrong coupons first and then each morning had to wait in line at the really slow reception desk to get them exchanged for the right ones...This took place every day for 4 days! The internet in the rooms is on and off and if ""on"" then really slow. Parties take place outside with LOUD singing sometimes until 1AM! The other side of the building is a busy street...The swimming pool area is clean. Taxis can be arranged (sometimes it takes a while). The rooms have a complicated light system, too many switches connected to each other. It takes time to get used to. There is a safe in each room, you will get two bottles of water every day and a packet of coffee (no tea).

It was an OK place to lay your head,  but it didn't seem to excel at anything.   Sheets were clean but stained.  The shower dripped out a paltry stream of water.  The towels were so old and over bleached that you could cut yourself on them.   However,  like the town, the hotel had one great attribute.   Veracruz is not a pretty place or a tourist destination in my opinion.   However, carnaval is a world class party.  We were blown away by the parade we attended and the party atmosphere.

The room was without a view, i.e. the window opened into the interior hotel ""column"". Some people may not care for an interior room but it does cut down on the street noise. Room appointed in a fairly basic manner but everything is new and nice. It was a big room and could probably use a little bit more light, especially since an interior room receives little natural light. Meant to eat at the restaurant off the hotel lobby but never got around to doing so. Others have noted the hotel WiFi as being dodgy; I had no issues whatsoever with the hotel WiFi (strong continuous signal throughout my stay).

787,"When It's Good, It's Very Good",4,1,2014,RobertSDF,"I visit Veracruz often but my first experience with this hotel. And, for the most part, a good experience. My room was one of their king rooms in the new section. Basic furniture but all very clean and well maintained. The advertised balcony is really just a small area with enough room to step out. TV was good but I don't like the remote being attached to the nightstand since I wanted to use it in other parts of the room. The room had a safe but useless since it would not open. If you need internet access , as I do, you might want to look elsewhere. When it works, it is ok. But after many attempts to repair it, I could never be sure I would have it available. To their credit they tried but that was only after a rude encounter with a desk clerk.  Having mentioned the desk clerk who was rude and only wanted to argue with me about the internet, I hasten to add that the other staff members were excellent and some of the most helpful I have encountered anywhere.  And they seemed to be really proud of their little hotel. Many names I don't know but I will mention one I do know, Joel.  He was outstanding. Seems to do a bit of everything. He carried my luggage, waited on me in the restaurant and I also saw him cleaning. Really an excellent, enthusiastic employee. It is interesting that the staff was so good considering the manager would never speak to me and really would try to hide when I approached the desk and he was there. Forutunately, his staff is much better than the boss. I would recommend the hotel. Just be aware of the internet situation.

We had a 2 room suite with our good friends that had a connecting sitting room. The tiling and furniture is ""old school"" and quaint. There is a lovely view on the rooftop--wish they had put some chairs up there.     We did not try the restaurant but did go the the Irish Pub for drinks on the premises. Very nice. The hotel location is great but I wouldn't want a room facing the square due to loud music. I wish they wouldn't have glued down this giant vase on the bathroom tiled counter--right in the middle!

However it was clean and comfortable, and suited us fine.   One of the best things about the Posada is that parking was so incredibly easy. The moment we arrived outside the hotel, a valet took our car and drove it into the on-site  parking garage which is right alongside reception. And unlike US hotels, it was free.   Our only compliant was that internet access via the wifi was extremely patchy and was not password protected.…","Responded Mar 25, 2022","Response from gerardo herrera, Director General at Posada Santa FeResponded Mar 25, 2022",Thanks for staying with us.

791,Beautiful,5,3,2022,Patricia Edsjo,"The receptionist and staff were very friendly and helped us with bags, questions and to order a taxi in the morning to the bus station. We got the last room available which was the suite. Bathroom was clean and modern.  The noise from the street is mainly from happy people enjoying food, it didn’t bother us at all, it is something that is included if you choose to stay in a hotel in the middle of everything! :) The mariachi‘s played until about 11:30pm and after that there was not much noise.

793,"Location,  Views, Convenience",4,12,2021,CharlieG69,"The other reviews have said it mostly.  Let me sum up.   Location. Guanajuato has much of the city unaccessable by car/taxi.  This hotel has parking, down it's back street on reservation.  Some other hotels you might have to carry your bags some distance.  As it was, I had to carry my bags a block at midnight, and then call to be let in.   It is in the city center, on a park square, with most of the public buildings, monuments, etc.  When you are walking a lot coming to a home base that is close is important.  A  hotel off the beatin path might be nice too.  The   Views.  None of the reviews talked about the roof of the hotel.  It has some nice views that are worth the stay alone.  I asked for an upper floor room, thinking I might get one of those balconies by default.  No dice, but sitting on the roof was plenty consolation for the two flights of stairs. Plus, it largely cut out the noise  from the square.  The hot tub was out of commission though.    Convenience.  This is a historic hotel.  Small rooms, mexican tiled  bathrooms, carved wood  doors.   If you decided to come to Guanajuato, why would you stay in a Hilton? The hotel has a hodge podge design, of convoluted stairs and additions,  that resemble the towns construction, built up over centuries.  It has a beautiful old world lobby.  The staff were on the spot, and helpful with old school butler efficiency, answering all  questions.…","Responded Jan 3, 2022","Response from gerardo herrera, Director General at Posada Santa FeResponded Jan 3, 2022",Thanks for staying with us.

794,Friendly service in a historic venue,4,12,2021,MagdaKettleStorm," Posada Sante Fe is centrally located on a shady gorgeous square, wonderful to hang out in the outdoor cafe. The food was a mix of decent and not so great.  The staff was super friendly and helpful, helped us buy theater tickets and an early taxi to the airport. They never tried to ""sell us"" something as I read in another review. Outlets had no ground so I had to recharge my computer with the front desk staff and they were very nice about it. This is a historic hotel so rooms are a bit funky but so many of the other hotels have bland remodels; at least here you still have character, wooden beams across the ceiling etc. We paid extra for a balcony which I thought would get us the sunny remodelled front rooms but instead put us on the back alley above a smelly french fry place, waste of money there. I think rooms 6,7,8,9 are on the front, gorgeous.  The mariachis below at the restaurants on the square aren't so bad on the weekdays but will be very loud on the weekends if you are in a front room.…","Responded Dec 17, 2021","Response from gerardo herrera, Director General at Posada Santa FeResponded Dec 17, 2021",Thanks for staying with us.

The hotel is beautiful and the staff were wonderful and made us feel so welcome. The room was very clean with comfortable beds and quality bedding.

Be warned that the noise level is high at all times of the day, due to the many musicians on the ground floor. We did not mind the noise but something to consider.   The rooms and hotel in general is very old and needs a lot of work. Would give it a 4 in terms of cleanliness.   In addition the staff is not very friendly and they are constantly trying to sell you something. We found ourselves dodging the staff members. Very uncomfortable.

Rooms were lovely, well-appointed and clean. The included Breakfast is provided by the restaurant next door and was very good with good service. If you need to depart before the 9am restaurant opening the hotel will arrange for coffee and breakfast items from the Starbucks next door. I was in an orthopedic boot. Although not too bad, there are stairs from the lobby to the elevator and steps down then up again to get from the elevator to the room. Also, the staff warned us that because of electric water heaters you may have to wait 10-15 minutes between showers.

800,Beautiful Neo Classical Hotel with wonderful staff in a gorgeous part of Guanajuato,5,2,2022,lakecomodude,"This is a fantastic boutique hotel in a gorgeous part of a stunningly beautiful city. My bedroom was beautiful with a separate sitting area and high ceilings. The ceilings were made of beautiful dark wood. Everything is tastefully done. There was a large flatscreen TV in the sitting area and another one in the bedroom. Both have access to prime video, Netflix and any other streaming service.  Every staff member I dealt with was extremely friendly. In particular, the hotel manager, Beatriz or Betty, was so warm and friendly. She gave me great advice on restaurants and then followed up to make sure they met my expectations – – which they did.  This is simply a great hotel but I do have one caveat. It surprises me that more reviewers have not stated this. Because the hotel sits in a beautiful square, there is loud thumping music that goes on until 3 AM from Friday through Sunday. It literally sounds as if you are in a nightclub. The hotel provides earplugs but they don’t do much to stop the noise.  The only way I could get to sleep at night was to put on my iPods at full blast playing white noise. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to sleep. I love this hotel and will come back but I will ask Beatriz to find a room for me that is as quiet as possible because getting to sleep here with the loud music is very difficult.…","Responded Mar 9, 2022","Response from Mari Carmen S Director de Relaciones Públicas, Agencia/Consultora at 1850 Hotel BoutiqueResponded Mar 9, 2022"," Dear Guest,  We want to express our gratitude for choosing us during your trip to Guanajuato City and for sharing your comment with this community that are always looking for the best experience.

801,"December 26, 2021 to December 30, 2021 Trip to Guanajuto, Guanajuto Mexico",5,1,2022,Tim Hardin,This was our first time visiting Guanajuto. We drove 8 hours from Monterrey NL Mexico.  If you drive you need to reserve parking with the hotel.  They have spaces held at one of the local garages.  There is no parking directly at the hotel. We were told to call 10 minutes out from the designated spot and would be greeted so that our bags could be taken to hotel and our car taken to the garage.  This process was seamless.  There were 2 people wearing 1850 Hotel face mask so we could easily identify the staff. Check in was excellent.  The front desk staff do speak english which is great since I am a gringo from the US.  The front desk staff Vacelin and Mariana were excellent and talked with us everyday.  They went out of their way to ensure we had a great stay and they did not disappoint.  We stayed in the Victoria Master Suite which had very high ceiling and a balcony that overlooks Union Garden.  Yes Union Gardens can be very noisy at night until around 2 am and you can hear the bands in your room.  However that is part of the charm of this historic hotel.  I found if you close the shutters and turn the fan up on the air conditioner you really cannot hear the noise.  Plus the hotel does provide ear plugs.  The room is actually a 2 room suite on the third floor. The bathroom you have to go up a small set of stairs.  The bed is extremely comfortable and slept very well during the trip.  This is probaby the best hotel in Guanajuto.  There is a placard on the outside of the hotel that the building was once the Casino of Guanajuto from 1850.  The hotel does not have a restauraunt but they do serve food in roof top bar that is delivered from a local restaraunt.  Breakfast was included each day at a local restaurant.  Food and coffee was very good.  They have a diferent menu for the hotel.guest. The roof top bar had excellent views of the city.  Drinks were very good.  The were closed on Mondays.  The city is very pedestrian friendly.  Driving around is not reccomended.  The city utilizes a series of tunnels to maneuver around the city.  You can get lost in these as GPS will not work.  I highly recommend doing the funicular to go to Pipilla.  It is the highest point overlooking the city.  Gives you the best pictures of all the colors.  Go in the morning as it can get very crowded.  There are alot of museums.  I highly recommend Diego Riveria museum.  Also night time is a great time to walkaround the city.  The city is very safe however there are some areas to avoid.  Ask the front desk and they can help. The mummy museum is overrated.  We waited 2  hours in the sun.  The museum is about 3 KM away from hotel.  Do not walk to. Not the best area and very steep hills.  Overall I highly recommend the 1850 Hotel and a visit to this historic treasure.…,"Responded Mar 11, 2022","Response from Mari Carmen S Director de Relaciones Públicas, Agencia/Consultora at 1850 Hotel BoutiqueResponded Mar 11, 2022","Dear Mr. Timmy_Hard  We want to sincerely thank you for your preference as well as your kind and detailed comment. We are very happy to know that you had a pleasant stay.  As you mentioned, we are located in a pedestrian area which makes the issue of vehicles a bit difficult, however we always try to go beyond helping the guests and that is why we suggest that you always call us before arriving in the city so we can give you the best tips such as instructions if you bring a car and also being able to reserve a place because we do not have own parking as we are located in the main garden where cars are not allowed, we only have a few places and it is better to reserve in advance.  The best suggestion maybe would be not to bring a car because, as you mentioned, it is a city to walk around and if you want to go to more distant places, we can support you with transportation services at an additional cost or call a taxi, any option for you to decide.  All our reception staff speak English and that makes it easy to give you the best advice and suggestions during your visit to this beautiful city, restaurants, bars, museums and places of interest. It is good to know that this was useful for you.  The Victoria Master Suite is one of our pampered rooms overlooking the main garden of the city which, especially during the weekend, can be a bit noisy for some people, so if your hearing is not sensitive we highly recommend it otherwise we have 14 interior rooms where noise will not be a problem, feel free to call us so we can offer the characteristics of each room by phone and you can decide what is best.  Indeed we do not have our own restaurant but we solve the food service with a restaurant that is a few steps from the hotel where several options are offered.  We greatly appreciate the advice you give to all readers of Tripadvisor and for our part we remind you that this will always be your home in Guanajuato.  Greetings from all the staff 1850"

805,An absolute must!,5,11,2021,Jocelyn G,"While there are many historically beautiful hotels in the area, there are none in comparison to the 1850 Hotel Boutique. While there 4 Diamond awards are outstanding accomplishments, what impressed me most was there excellent service and hospitality.   This was my first time visiting this beautiful city, and I felt completely safe, and we’ll taken care of. Berenice at the reception made our tour and room arrangements effortlessly. Her willingness to answer any of our questions put us at ease and her recommendations were the absolute best. We also had the pleasure of meeting the general manager Beatriz who was very kind, and provided us with great insight on the city. Daniel also provided us with amazing hospitality, he made sure we had transportation arrangements set, while also adding special touches that made our experience with the hotel very special. The service was impeccable, everything from housekeeping, security staff, to checking in was awesome.  We made the mistake of getting a tour with the promoters on the Main Street and the service was crappy. The tour guides just stayed on their phones and dropped us off at the sites, while not mentioning that the additional entrance fees and costs were not included when they said they were. We used the recommendations and contacts provided by the hotel and we felt very safe and had a great time. Their services were prompt, punctual and very exciting.  There are many perks that we loved while staying here as well. Any last minute toiletries can be provided by the reception, as well as a variety of pillows that provide that additional level of attention to their guests. The hotel itself is extremely well kept, safe, and very clean. I am not being paid by the hotel, nor am I a promoter. I am simply a tourist who was extremely impressed by this establishment. The best part about this hotel is the location, you are at the center of all the excitement, with everything being walking distance. Not once did we have to use a taxi or Uber.  Everything from the Mercado Hidalgo, Finicular Panoramico Guanajuato, Teatro Juarez to the Callejoniadas, are infront of you. The plaza in-front has lively music, where you can enjoy a cup of fresh elotes, or simply people watch. We also enjoyed the rooftop bar/ lounge on the fourth floor, it had an awesome view of the Pipilar and Cathedral (Very IG worthy). I highly recommend this hotel, and would definitely come back.

806,"Could not give this the highest rating, especially in light of the high prices and some issues.",4,11,2021,BLDTraveler,"Wow, a lot to tell about this place. The hotel itself is quite nice. The staff (at least behind the desk) all spoke English. All the staff were very nice and helpful. Hats off to the cleaning staff. They kept on top of everything (exception below). Furnishings were nice, bed comfortable and public sitting areas seemed to be around every corner. High ceilings made the room feel larger. We booked one of the two grand suites (the Victoria). There is an elevator although the hotel only has two floors to speak of. When we arrived, their was a small welcome bag of trinkets on the bed. The promised newspapers mentioned on the website were not to be found.  Location is a mixed blessing (more below). It is very central and walking distance to many things. Guanajuato is a hilly town, so bring comfortable shoes. Cabs are everywhere outside the pedestrian zone. Uber is here, but sketchy. We wanted to go to San Miguel de Allende (not worth it in our opinion). First driver said he needed to get gas and never returned. Then cancelled the trip. The next one started driving only to tell us that something from his divorce meant he would have to drop us 20 minutes outside of town. That wasn't going to work. Finally took a cab. About $50.00 with tip each way. Beware asking the hotel to arrange this for you. They quoted us about 3 times the price.  Plenty of restaurants within walking distance. Starbucks is next door if you need a fix. Look around. We found both French and Italian in addition to the plethora of Mexican places. What we could not find was a decent local panderia. That was odd. Lots of shops and pharmacies and small ""everything"" grocery stores (Oxxo).  Now some things to note. First, this is directly across from the Jardin de la Union, which is a pedestrian zone. Means you will have to schlep your bags from the designated taxi drop off area. Not far. They did bring our bags to the taxi when we left, so I am sure you can get assistance upon arrival as well.  The hotel had an exercise area that looked permanently closed. Their is no concierge as stated and they have been without for the past 18 months, per the staff. There is no on-site restaurant although one two doors down where you take breakfast (if included). The ""spa"" looks to be an appointments only sort of deal and appears quite small. The bar is open air on the top floor, so no where to have a cocktail if it is raining. There is a Nespreso in the room, but you only get 2 capsules per day even if two people. What they give you is totally random, but you can buy more of them for $1.50 USD each.  There are earplugs in the bathroom for good reason. Being across from the square meant mariachi music until 10 or 12 every night. And often it was competing, so it was a cacophony of sound. Shutting the inside wooden doors helped somewhat. Then there is Bar One upstairs. The sound from it pours in through the central skylight. And it is loud dance music. You can expect it until midnight during the week and 2 AM on weekends. And it is VERY popular. One night there was a couple who were obviously locals headed for the bar who looked like they might have sex right in the lobby. This was right in front of the front desk person who simply ignored them. Apparently entitled people are everywhere and tolerated. And we were there during a two day wine festival on the plaza that also had music. This is not a quiet hotel.  Toiletries are top notch, but do not expect them to replace the near empty ones without asking. There is a mini-bar in the room, but no place to store any leftovers you may have, nor place to reheat. Our room did have a balcony, but it was for standing only. No place to sit.  The hotel did arrange for our per-departure Covid tests. I am sure it was marked up as well as everything, else, but it was convenient, done right at the hotel. Took 15-20 minutes. I think it was $60.00 each, cash only.  Look, I am not totally panning this place, but you need to know before you go. We paid about $300/night, and that was MXN converted to USD. Was it worth it? Hard to say. $225-$250 would have seemed much more in line. Also note that the suites are about 450 square feet. Two rooms. The website pictures are deceiving and make them look bigger. Would I stay there again? Not on the weekend, that's for sure.…","Responded Dec 16, 2021","Response from Mari Carmen S Director de Relaciones Públicas, Agencia/Consultora at 1850 Hotel BoutiqueResponded Dec 16, 2021"," Dear BLD Traveler,  On behalf of 1850 staff, we really appreciate your review about us, as this feedback help us to improve each time, our main value is service and we are committed to it, so we are glad to know you felt assisted and well treated by us.   Somehow, our city is beautiful because downtown is protected, conserved and maintained as much as originally was, so it keeps its hilly essence. Unfortunately, is not a city to drive in but to walk by and, as you suggest, it’s better to bring comfortable shoes. Nevertheless, we sorry you didn’t have a good experience with local cabs or Uber service. That’s a shame! On the other hand, our transportation prices can be perceived as high and we totally understand customers can expect a more affordable price but the service we offer is completely private and provided by reliable suppliers, which will give you a professional and complete service from pick up to drop off.   Guanajuato city has been growing and focusing in giving to locals and visitors a better experience when it’s about food. Nowadays we have several options going from the most popular and local food to the most fancy national/international menu and most of them are located in downtown. Unfortunately, panaderias are still popular among Mexican families but times are changing and the most significant ones have suffered it. Nevertheless, we could have assisted you by recommending a few of them which are located in downtown. Feel free to ask us anything you need!

If it was in our hands, you can be sure that we would welcome you on our main door as soon as you left the car, but city is kept for walking and respecting the space for everybody. However, we are prepared for this and our bell boy staff is ready to help you with your bags, so you can get rid of weight and worries when you leave the car and cross our doors.  Due to current health and hygiene circumstances, our gym is only opened with prior notification. We are sorry if there was a miscommunication between us that made you think it’s closed. For our security and mostly for our guests’ we open our gym when requested by them, so we can sanitize it before and after is used. For what has already been mentioned previously, regarding the care of the historical and cultural heritage, is not possible for us to have our own restaurant or a pergola on our rooftop. Guanajuato downtown and its buildings are protected by INAH, an institute who’s in charge of cultural and historical heritage so we must follow their policies and respect the building, so its beauty remains. But that is not a hindrance for us to provide you a magnificent breakfast at the restaurante next door, which is one of the best restaurants in town.  As mentioned before, rooms and hotel are designed to be modern but respecting the structure, so space is not enough to place a bigger fridge nor even a microwave; nevertheless, you can always ask us for help either for saving your leftovers or reheating them, as we have equipment in our lobby to replace those details in the rooms. We kindly regret the lack of communication that could have undermined your experience.   As previously mentioned, we are committed with service and we are prepared not just to welcome you but also to give you a warm farewell. Your experience is not about the destination per se but it starts since the moment you are looking for a flight and a hotel, thank you so much for chossing us, we would really appreciate if you have future plans to visit this amazing city again, you can call us and we will recommend you the best room, we have other quite rooms that has no face to the main garden so you can avoid the noice of the street and the bars.  Best regards and happy holidays! "
807,Centrally located oasis,5,10,2021,Laura K,"We absolutely loved our stay at this beautiful hotel. It offers the best of both worlds: it's in the middle of all the action - steps away from the Jardín, the Teatro Juarez, shops and restaurants -- but, once you step through it's doors, you enter a quiet, welcoming oasis.  Our beautiful room had a small balcony that looked out on the Jardín. We could stand on the balcony to hear wonderful music, or close the doors for peace and quiet.  But the best part of the experience was the wonderful staff. They were kind and helpful at every step. And they even went so far as to write a welcome note to our dog, signed by everyone. Our dog loved to run into the lobby to say hello to everyone. This is probably the most dog-friendly hotel we've ever stayed at.

810,Beautiful resort with major inconveniences,2,9,2020,scrubs21,First off would like to say this is a beautiful property. The rooms are spacious the grounds are kept well. The paint on the buildings is even well kept up. The patio furniture is new. On an aesthetic view it’s phenomenal. This however cannot make up for the major pains the hotel had. The most frustrating thing is the internet doesn’t work in the rooms. The rooms walls are so thick there is spotty and signal drops all the time you are forced to teather. I changed rooms due to the internet but even with changing rooms it’s the same thing. If you sit outside it’s fine. The other thing that is frustrating is I had my lock box changed twice. One was completely dead and then the second one they brought was so tiny it just fit cash and my passport. Being a luxury 5 star resort I expected more. It’s best to know Spanish as English is limited. The property is far from most local touristy things and there’s not much around it so be prepared to taxi …,"Responded Mar 17, 2021","Response from Klaus Lapp, Director General at Villa Maria CristinaResponded Mar 17, 2021"," Dear guest: Thank you very much for taking the time to share your recent experience and stay at the Villa Maria Cristina, member of Small Luxury Hotels of the World. I have taken note of your comments regarding the internet / Wi-Fi signal. Hotel Villa Maria Cristina is an historic building and stonewalls are in some parts of the hotel at least 60 cm thick. That is one of the reasons why you may have experienced a weak signal. We are now in the process of upgrading our routers to the newest Wi-Fi 6 standard, using the latest available technology. I am pleased to inform you that now at least 90% of the property has a good Wi-Fi reception. Regarding the safety boxes, we also have changed them to accommodate at least a laptop. Regarding our location, we are located in the ancient Embassy district of Guanajuato, a very upscale and safe neighborhood. The city center is only 15 minutes walking distance away. Due to the way the City is build, with many tunnels and hills and narrow streets, if you don´t want to walk, the very affordable and safe taxis are the best way to move around. On many occasions, whatever your attraction objective is, it may take longer to get there by car then walking because of the layout of Guanajuato, which is why we always encourage our guests to bring comfortable walking shoes along and explore the beauty of this 3 century old city by foot. We are glad that we exceeded in general your lodging, Food & Beverage and your service expectations. On behalf of the entire team and management we hope to be able to welcome you or your family or friends sometime back in the future to this UNESCO World Heritage site.  Once again, thank you for posting your constructive review. Yours sincerely, Klaus M. Lapp General Manager  "

817,POOR QUALITY HOTEL,1,7,2021,Calefer M,"I had a reservation for a 2 bed room. The front woman  Yeslin told me she had no more rooms available and gave me room 20 which is not a room is a cage. So small the light of the hallway is in your eyes all night long since curtain is smaller. Noise all night   No soap nor towels Had to ask for them and of course the guy wants a tip regardless it should be there. Yislem the front woman is disrespectful and trained to lie to the guests . She should of told me the truth that my room was sold out and the only room they had was the cage (20) .   Next morning I talked to the manager Carla she could not do much and she said that I could have a better room for double the price but I chose not to . LIE they never showed me nor offered me another room nor should I have to pay more. Deceiving information. This people Don’t honor the booking website rate . That is aTHEFT and disloyal competition since you don’t get to  book with hotels that are serous and honor the rates.  NEVER had I encountered this.  Awful staff clearly trained to be arrogant and play along with the scheme .   Had to get in contact with The “director “ Armando Lopez . He was so arrogant on the phone said he was driving and would call me back ... never did . How about pulling aside and listening the side of the guest ??? He clearly doesn’t care .   A cave of unprofessional staff led by a careless arrogant management style that give Guanajuato a bad name because of this people. Never seen this , even their responses to other guests here are outrageous.    STAY AWAY there are plenty of good decent hotel management in town.

When we arrived the wifi in the hotel was not working. Due to remote working we had checked that wifi was available and included before travelling so we were disappointed that for the entire 4 days of our stay there was no consistent internet.

822,Hidden little gem in the heart of Guanajuato,5,11,2021,Stacey L,"My husband and I stayed at La Notaría for a week and a half this past summer and had a lovely vacation. We got to know the staff, the owners, and the even the owners' families! Here are the highlights and a few minor areas of improvement we discovered during our stay. Overall, we highly recommend this charming little boutique hotel nestled in the heart of Guanajuato.  PROS:  -GREAT LOCATION-Smack dab in the center of downtown Guanajuato. The city is located in a bowl-shaped valley. La Notaría is located in the flat bottom so no awkward or steep hills to navigate. Great location for walking to all the popular sights.  -EXCELLENT SERVICE-Staff at the Rooftop Bar are especially prescient. They’ll remember special drinks and preferences and have cocktails ready the minute you sit down. Shout out to Jacobo & Enrique who made us feel especially welcome and comfortable!  -Newly remodeled rooms with modern furniture.  -Very responsive staff-Any room issues are addressed quickly.  -Locally owned-One of the owners are usually on the property, are very approachable, and are always overseeing the satisfaction of the guests.  -FANTASTIC rooftop bar-Staff will try to accommodate drink AND music requests. (Another shout out to Jacobo!) We had a longer stay so the bar stocked the ingredients for my favorite cocktail! They also let my husband stream his favorite playlists over their speaker system. Really fun and relaxed place with beautiful views. I recommend a visit even if you’re not staying at the hotel.  -Affordable rates-Especially if you book directly with the hotel.  -Fans in all of the rooms  -Daily housekeeping  -Good in-room pod coffee makers  -In-house coffee shop  -Breakfast vouchers at a great restaurant-Casa Valadez is very good and just around the block from the hotel.  CONS:  -Hotel is located inside of an older building with some issues- I think this comes with the territory when lodging downtown where many of the building are over 100 hundred years old.  We had small issues with a leak & power outages during a rainstorm, and water from the fixtures was slow to heat up.  -Lack of storage inside rooms-Would have loved to have more drawers/shelves in the furniture, a full length wardrobe with hanging space for dresses (there aren't any closets) and some shelves and hooks on the walls.  -Majority of staff doesn’t speak English-All of management speaks English but difficult to communicate with daily staff if you’re an English-only speaking tourist.  -Very loud night club across the street-How the loud music affects you depends on the location of your room. When booking our stay, the hotel was very upfront about this and was strategic about assigning our rooms. We were still able to sleep soundly once we closed the windows and doors and with the help of the white noise from the fans.…","Responded Mar 4, 2022","Response from Bernardo Calzada Nájera, Propietario at La Notaría HotelResponded Mar 4, 2022","Hola Stacey, thank you for your comments, they help us to improve our service and facilities.

827,The best of the best,5,4,2022,Ron R,"Casa Zuniga it’s not in the center of town, but up the hill next to the monument and the Finicular. A multi level multi faceted work of construction art, Rick has been building this property for over a decade. Artistic and decorative sights  lurk around every corner. We stayed in the Morgan suite which was quite large with a jumbo bed a great bathroom with a terrific shower and great water pressure. Wi-Fi was always good. The view of the city was amazing. Coffee was available every morning at 7:30 AM followed by a huge family style breakfast at 9 AM. Every day it was fresh fruit, juice, coffee or tea. One day it was a terrific omelette with mushrooms and cheese and the next day fantastic enchiladas. It is a short ride down via the fanicular or you can take the many steps down and trudge back up. Rick provides tickets for the ride up and down, so why walk. It is nice and peaceful and quiet up there compared to staying in the center of town. Guanajuato has many tourists and locals crowded into several small streets that provide a cacophony of joyous noise however it can be a little overwhelming just like New Year’s Eve in Times Square. Guanajuato has incredible history going back hundreds of years and Rick seems to know it all. A fantastic stay with fantastic hosts Rick and Carmen are the real deal and a pleasure to be with…","Responded Apr 12, 2022","Response from Carmen and Rick Zuniga, Owner at Casa Zuniga B&BResponded Apr 12, 2022","We do have a view and the trade off is we are above the center of the village. The Teatro Juarez is the center of the village. We are about a football field above the Teatro Juarez.  It's just a 90 second Funicular ride down to the Center of the village or running full blast you can make it about 2 minutes or less if you don't fall.  We started building January 1st 2005 and finished in mid 2007, 46,300 square feet. Since we blew the wad on the building, we were forced to make our own decorations. So  we've been down in the backyard whipping up decorations for the house ever since. All of our rooms have king size beds and private baths with water that is pressurized, purified, softened and multi filtered.  The center of our village only has a half dozen streets so they can get nice and cozy with people pretty fast.  Guanajuato is where it happened,  Rocks carved into gigantic frogs over 8,000 years ago. The richest producing mine in the world. The cause of the fall of the Spanish Empire, The first battle for the  birth of Mexico,  Benny for a while Made Guanajuato the capital of the country.  Max the ""Empire"" of Mexico used to live down the street. Jose, the last Mexican muralist to die and  a disciple of Diego, made Guanajuato his home. Diego's house is just down the street and  around the corner. Of the 13 man made wonders of Mexico, Guanajuato has numero 2. Thanks for the review Ron and hurry back. Carmen & Rick"

I will definitely be back again, not because of the Colonial charm and beauty of Guanajuato, the fantastic Mexican cuisine or the spectacular views from our room(Morgan Suite) balcony that rivals that of Monumento de Pipila, but because of our host, Rick, of Casa Zuniga, who made the trip so much more enjoyable and memorable.           Rick was absolutely delightful and embodies the word hospitality.  His accommodating nature and his encyclopedic wealth of information regarding Guanajuato is simply astonishing.  His personal life experience coupled with relationships he has within the city and his story-telling nature gave us a unique perspective of a local.  Rick, his wife Carmen, who is the inspiration behind Casa Zuniga, and team all work in concert to make you feel welcome and at home .  They were very responsive and communicated well in advance of our arrival as well as departure to ensure everything goes smoothly.  I could go into more detail but my description of being there would pale in comparison to the actual experience in person.     If you’re going to Guanajuato, I definitely recommend staying at Casa Zuniga which is situated right next to Monumento de Pipila, one of the main attractions of the city with breathtaking and panoramic view of Guanajuato.  The city-center or “Centro” is a quick tram ride(Finuclar) down but if you like to walk or hike, you can certainly take the steps down to the city center but taking them back up will definitely be a cardio workout.   Great location and accessibility to the city but most important, the hosts and team at Casa Zuniga were hospitably fantastic!   Rick, be ready for the return visit!…","Responded Mar 7, 2022","Response from Carmen and Rick Zuniga, Owner at Casa Zuniga B&BResponded Mar 7, 2022","Thank you Allison and Mark for your kind words.

835,"Nice hotel, but....",3,2,2020,Laura K,"We stayed two nights in February in room 11.  The room itself was nice but basic.  The bathroom was one step up from the main room, which was a bit disconcerting when we had to use the bathroom during the night and tripped on the step in the dark.  Also, there must have been some plumbing issues during our stay because the room had an unpleasant mildewy/sewer-like smell coming from the bathroom.  We kept the door closed to the shower and the room, which helped. There were a couple of other rooms on the same floor that were open. We  hacked them and they also had an off smell.  The breakfast at the other hotel was adequate.

836,"Nice, clean, and perfect location ",5,1,2020,Jose P,The hotel was great but if your looking for a quiet  hotel this wont be for you. This hotel is located next to the towns cathedral and bells go off pretty much every hour and the town likes to party so you can hear everything. Honestly we don't mind and we have children. The hotel also offers continental breakfast and its pretty good. The wife is pretty picky but she loved it. Remember this hotel is downtown so if you don't mind the bells then this place is perfect. ,"Responded Jan 5, 2020","Response from GrupoLeyendas, Director de Recepción at Hotel de la PazResponded Jan 5, 2020","Hello Jose , On behalf of those of us who work at Hotel de la Paz, we appreciate your visit and valuable comments.

837,Affordable Heritage at a Great Location,4,12,2019,Prasanna Vee,"While  this place might not be the fanciest place to stay -  or boutique - it  is one of the best Value-for-money options in town, with a lot of character and great location. Your basic needs would get taken care of and we didnt have any big complaints during our stay. And for the price we paid this is a steal! They also have  a nice terrace from which  you  can get an unobstructed view of the  Cathedral, Plaza and the Pastel coloured homes on the hilltop  LOCATION: Fantastic location right next to the cathedrals and in the heart of old town!   DINE + DRINK: They dont have a restaurant on site, but do provide a free breakfast at a posher restaurant a block away which is pretty  decent.  ROOM: We stayed in Room  9, so this review is based on that; VIEW: Sweet  view of the  UNIVERSITY from one of the windows; SIZE: Very spacious room; AIR-CON: Very poor Air conditioner that couldnt Cool the room well enough and made it difficult to sleep under warmer than desired conditions!!; BED: Comfortable bed that played the expected part to put me to sleep; BATHROOM: Stand in shower; TOILETRIES: Random cosmetics, bring  your own!  FACILITIES:  No Gym or Pool, just pure Mexican Chill!  SERVICE: Friendly staff that took care of all my needs with a smile and made us feel at  home, and well taken care of.   HOW WIRED YOU WILL BE: Free medium speed Wi-Fi that works well all over the property. Plasma TV screen dishing out dozens of channels spanning sports, news, music, movies and a wide variety of entertainment -  But ONLY IN  SPANISH mostly!! So not  much to watch  if you  dont understand Espanol!…","Responded Dec 2, 2019","Response from GrupoLeyendas, Director de Recepción at Hotel de la PazResponded Dec 2, 2019","Dear  traveltalesofales: Thank you very much for your comments.

838,Might deserve a 5 rating but ....,4,11,2019,Kerryrain,"This hotel has a killer central location in an exceptionally charming town; french windows and balcony; outstanding view of University steps; friendly helpful receptionists - particularly Beatrice who speaks English well; comfortable bed, great shower, generous toiletries, coffee and tea in reception room.  The room and the hotel in general is spotlessly clean.   Now the bad aspects that the hotel may not control:  I guess it is the restaurant nextdoor that has a band.  The music started around 8 pm and they played until 5 am at max volume.  I had planned to get up early and enjoy Guanajuato without so many tourists but I was so tired that when the music stopped  I slept until 8 am.   I then went to the lovely hotel across the street (owned by same group) for breakfast.  (Breakfast was included in the price of my room.)  I was greeted by a chaotic situation with a long line of people waiting to get into the room with the buffet food and NO tables available.  I waited a little while, decided the situation was hopeless and left.  I came back an hour later and managed to snag the one empty table.  Most of the food was gone but there was scrambled eggs and coffee and that was all I wanted.  There was nothing pleasant about breakfast - disappointing since I had limited my search to hotels that included breakfast thereby eliminating some really good places.  I would have enjoyed breakfast at the restaurants right across the street from the hotel.    Bottom line - this is a great hotel in most aspects but I would not stay there again.…","Responded Dec 2, 2019","Response from GrupoLeyendas, Director de Recepción at Hotel de la PazResponded Dec 2, 2019","Hello Dear Kerry We are very sorry for your experience.

839,Great location.  Spacious rooms.  Good value,5,4,2021,Qwert1a,"Stayed one night at Don Lucas.   The receptionist was ready for me as the hotel had texted asking what time I would arrive.  The room was on the second floor – no elevator.  I don’t know if all their rooms are like the one I had, but it would be more accurate to describe the room as an apartment than a hotel room.  There was a good sized living room which also had a sink, microwave, and small fridge.   A complementary bottle of wine waited for me on the table.  The bedroom was equally spacious even with a king bed.  The space had air conditioning.  Although the room faced the street, it was quiet enough, especially when the head wooden doors closed the windows facing the street.  The location is excellent, a few steps from the Plaza.  There are many shops, restaurants, and winding streets within close walking distance.   Breakfast was included and consisted of fruits, eggs, chips, bread, and beans…","Responded May 5, 2021","Response from Reservaciones Gpo Leyendas, Atención al huésped/Recepción at Hotel La Casona de Don LucasResponded May 5, 2021",Gracias!

841,Nice and central,4,3,2021,AJM,"I had fun staying here at this hotel because it is so centrally located in Guanajuato City.  I took a bus into town (1 1/2 hr from San Miguel Allende), and then took a taxi from the station to the hotel. The taxi driver left me off and pointed down the street!  Be aware of the narrow streets, possible closures for holidays or street fairs. So don’t overpack!  This hotel is right in the central plaza which is wonderful to access all the historic areas and fun. I was there for a fiesta, which can be noisy. I had no problem with noise by closing the wooden shutters to the Julliet balcony.  The room I had was huge! It had a “split” and ceiling fans, a sitting room with kitchenette, and plenty of hot water in the shower.  Breakfast was included: Basic and hot. (When you check in, you give the time you want to have breakfast in the breakfast room...for Covid distancing.)

842,To be avoided (the rating must be wrong),1,12,2020,Olivier,"We where staying here for a couple of nights and did not really enjoy our stay. The receptionist was quite rude and in stark contrast with other Mexican experiences we had. The hotel looks nice but the pictures where a bit deceiving. When we entered the room the room was smelling like there was an issue with the drain (and I really mean a bad smell), a thing we reported but was not taken care off. The breakfast next day was another dent to our experience. We got to wait quite a while for someone to take our order and when we ordered, only one dish arrived. A small plate of chilaquiles. We where waiting for the bread and eggs and asked if they got the order. The receptionist (the only one talking English) told us we needed to pay for the breakfast as it only includes that single dish (chilaquiles for everyone I guess). We where startled by the way she was telling us and where really upset by the tone she took.   All in all really our first terrible experience in Mexico, really sad it happened but oh well.

848,average,3,5,2022,electra2015,my experiences from these hotels has been positive so far. this one stands out because i think the owners dont pay attention to it. the bathroom had no warm water or adequate water flow. it was spacious yes but i also wanted to bathe. the breakfast area is in the center of the establishment and only has natural light from the top which is 7 ? stories high. so if you have and early morning the area is not adequately lit. also the breakfast bouffet is lacking in choice. very few things offered. the bed excellent as always. for me 2 were the worst elements: i tried to talk to receptionist over the phone and he didnt speak english well and i found a cockroach in the restroom at the reception area. i know this is a hotel for short stay but isnt the goal of every hotel to have people converging no matter what?…,Responded 1 week ago,"Response from IHG Service, Owner at Holiday Inn Express Guanajuato, an IHG HotelResponded 1 week ago","Hello electra2015,  Thanks for leaving your review on our property.

You have to take a taxi which costs approximately 70 pesos each way.  The room was very spacious and the bed comfortable but it but looks a little worn out, especially the bathrooms. What really dissatisfied me was that I took a shower and used a towel that was stained. Didn’t notice until I used it.  The breakfast wasn’t as good as it used to be.  They just had white bread and there was no toaster. No butter, no jelly.  Plain scrambled eggs.   In conclusion, I hope that they do a whole remodeling soon and that they improve the breakfast.

Also the hotel is right next to the Basilica so the church bells are really loud , specially when they ring at 7 am 😂, but well is part of the tradition of this town so for most people won’t be a big inconvenience .

861,Great location,4,6,2018,LeeHamm,"Casa Virreyes is centrally located, near the Plaza de la Paz, within walking distance of many restaurants and cafes. It was recommended to me, by a friend who lived in an apartment in one of the houses, many years ago. Two houses were combined to form the hotel. There is a central open space with a stained glass window skylight. The architecture is impressive but, as other reviewers have written, some of the rooms are dark and crowded, not at all like the bright, open rooms shown on the hotel's website.  There is a rooftop terrace with great views and some rooms have balconies. The inside-looking rooms are very quiet at night, though with very little natural light or ventilation, in the day.  Breakfast is served in the small restaurant downstairs. A sparse buffet is included but cooked breakfast is a small extra cost.  Parking is difficult with this hotel. You can park for free at another hotel some distance away or you can leave your vehicle in a 24 hour parking lot, some 10 minutes' walk away. This place charges $16 pesos per hour for every hour. I have to think the hotel could arrange an overnight fee with them and maybe offer a valet service. Driving in Guanajuato is difficult for people who are not familiar with the city, its one-way system and tunnels.  This is a nice hotel, though not inexpensive. Service was pleasant but, sorry Americans, you may need to speak some Spanish! There are usually lots of students around to help you navigate and communicate. Guanajuato is a lot more tourist-friendly than it used to be, with great coffee shops, lunch cafes and restaurants. Beware the crowds in October for the Cervantino festival!…","Responded Jun 21, 2018","Response from PJsMM, Director Comercial at Hotel Casa VirreyesResponded Jun 21, 2018","Dear guest: Thank you so much for your review, we are so happy to learn you enjoyed your stay with us and hope to be of service in the future."
862,Did not meet expectations,2,4,2018,ardenvalia,"We travelled with another couple, who booked this hotel via an online service, but the hotel was a big disappointment for us: 1. The hotel booking service policy was to pay on arrival (booked by the other couple). However, when we arrived, the total amount for both rooms was taken from the other couple's credit card (without authorization). This left a nice accounting mess for me to pay the other couple. 2. The receptionist spoke zero English. Really, a ""four-star"" hotel, where nobody at the font desk speaks English, although all the street ""poncho"" salespeople speak English.  3. The hotel booking site gave the impression that rooms had balconies with nice views of the city below. No such thing. Our room was on the first floor, with no balcony and only one window facing the inside corridor.  4. Room was hot and stuffy. No air-conditioner, only a fan. 5. When we arrived the first night, NO HOT WATER 6. The next morning, hotel water after we let the water run 10 minutes. 7. Very small TV 8. No refrigerador 9. Continental breakfast with AWFUL coffee. Seems like it was instant coffee, watered-down. Practically undrinkable. 10. NO INTERNET! We were on the ground floor, and an internet connection was available only sporadically. The lobby room was crowded with guests using the lobby  internet.  In fairness, the hotel did offer some advantages: 1. Excellent location -- smack in the center of the city. 2. Quiet. Other hotels in the area were next to bars with mariachi bands playing late into the night. 3. King-sized beds.  If one can get a guaranteed room in the upper floors, conditions are apparently better (internet)…","Responded May 4, 2018","Response from PJsMM, Director Comercial at Hotel Casa VirreyesResponded May 4, 2018","Dear guest: Thank you for your comments, we are sorry to hear your were not completely satisfied with our hotel.

863,Hidden little gem in the heart of Guanajuato,5,11,2021,Stacey L,"My husband and I stayed at La Notaría for a week and a half this past summer and had a lovely vacation. We got to know the staff, the owners, and the even the owners' families! Here are the highlights and a few minor areas of improvement we discovered during our stay. Overall, we highly recommend this charming little boutique hotel nestled in the heart of Guanajuato.  PROS:  -GREAT LOCATION-Smack dab in the center of downtown Guanajuato. The city is located in a bowl-shaped valley. La Notaría is located in the flat bottom so no awkward or steep hills to navigate. Great location for walking to all the popular sights.  -EXCELLENT SERVICE-Staff at the Rooftop Bar are especially prescient. They’ll remember special drinks and preferences and have cocktails ready the minute you sit down. Shout out to Jacobo & Enrique who made us feel especially welcome and comfortable!  -Newly remodeled rooms with modern furniture.  -Very responsive staff-Any room issues are addressed quickly.  -Locally owned-One of the owners are usually on the property, are very approachable, and are always overseeing the satisfaction of the guests.  -FANTASTIC rooftop bar-Staff will try to accommodate drink AND music requests. (Another shout out to Jacobo!) We had a longer stay so the bar stocked the ingredients for my favorite cocktail! They also let my husband stream his favorite playlists over their speaker system. Really fun and relaxed place with beautiful views. I recommend a visit even if you’re not staying at the hotel.  -Affordable rates-Especially if you book directly with the hotel.  -Fans in all of the rooms  -Daily housekeeping  -Good in-room pod coffee makers  -In-house coffee shop  -Breakfast vouchers at a great restaurant-Casa Valadez is very good and just around the block from the hotel.  CONS:  -Hotel is located inside of an older building with some issues- I think this comes with the territory when lodging downtown where many of the building are over 100 hundred years old.  We had small issues with a leak & power outages during a rainstorm, and water from the fixtures was slow to heat up.  -Lack of storage inside rooms-Would have loved to have more drawers/shelves in the furniture, a full length wardrobe with hanging space for dresses (there aren't any closets) and some shelves and hooks on the walls.  -Majority of staff doesn’t speak English-All of management speaks English but difficult to communicate with daily staff if you’re an English-only speaking tourist.  -Very loud night club across the street-How the loud music affects you depends on the location of your room. When booking our stay, the hotel was very upfront about this and was strategic about assigning our rooms. We were still able to sleep soundly once we closed the windows and doors and with the help of the white noise from the fans.…","Responded Mar 4, 2022","Response from Bernardo Calzada Nájera, Propietario at La Notaría HotelResponded Mar 4, 2022","Hola Stacey, thank you for your comments, they help us to improve our service and facilities.

So small the light of the hallway is in your eyes all night long since curtain is smaller. Noise all night   No soap nor towels Had to ask for them and of course the guy wants a tip regardless it should be there. Yislem the front woman is disrespectful and trained to lie to the guests . She should of told me the truth that my room was sold out and the only room they had was the cage (20) .   Next morning I talked to the manager Carla she could not do much and she said that I could have a better room for double the price but I chose not to . LIE they never showed me nor offered me another room nor should I have to pay more. Deceiving information. This people Don’t honor the booking website rate . That is aTHEFT and disloyal competition since you don’t get to  book with hotels that are serous and honor the rates.  NEVER had I encountered this.  Awful staff clearly trained to be arrogant and play along with the scheme .   Had to get in contact with The “director “ Armando Lopez . He was so arrogant on the phone said he was driving and would call me back ... never did . How about pulling aside and listening the side of the guest ??? He clearly doesn’t care .   A cave of unprofessional staff led by a careless arrogant management style that give Guanajuato a bad name because of this people. Never seen this , even their responses to other guests here are outrageous.    STAY AWAY there are plenty of good decent hotel management in town.

Bathroom inclusions: 2 washcloths, 2 bath towels, 2 hand towels, and a bath rug. Shampoo, lotion, shower gel, 2 soaps, no conditioner. A sewing kit, a shower cap, a shoe polisher, and a couple cotton balls and cotton swabs, Kleenex and a spare roll of tp.  Room inclusions: no coffee/coffeemaker. 2 glasses and 2 small bottles of water, a large armoire with hangers. A small safe that only fit my laptop because I removed the safe's shelf and because my laptop is only 11""; it would not fit a larger laptop. An overhead fan but no a/c or heating. The room had a small table and single chair, and a tv. It had several three-prong outlets (same voltage as American-style devices so no adapter/converter needed).  Overall remarks: The wifi was good and so was the hot water. (There's a shower but no bathtub.) If you're facing the street you could open the balcony doors to let in cool air but over the weekends especially it's very loud out there. The bed was fairly comfortable for a Mexican hotel, firmer by American standards but unusually soft for this side of the border. Each bed had 2 standard pillows and 2 throw pillows.  Breakfast was a block and a half away, at another hotel, from 8-10am. It was good. The offerings varied a bit each day but it generally included yogurt, fresh fruit (sliced and whole), granola, fresh-squeezed orange juice, coffee, cold cereal selection, rolls, scrambled eggs, beans, chilaquiles, and various salsa bar offerings. You'll definitely fill up and the food quality is pretty good.

883,Terrible location.  Poor service.  Bad food. Find another.,1,12,2018,Paco C,"Start with basics.  Location is bad.  You are up on a hill with no space to load / unload your luggage and reach the lobby without causing traffic jam in a highly transited tight street.  No accesible ramps and the hotel has lots of stairs and floors that you can only get to through stairs.  And this is not Guanajuato downtown, so you pay the price of hills and stairs without the benefit of a walk to downtown.  Taxis are 60 pesos to downtown.  Parking is up or down a hill and free.  Then the room.  We had no warm water during our stay.  Taking a cold water shower in December is far from our definition of vacation.  Towels were scarce and hard to get staff to get us more.  Rest of amenities in room were OK.  Then the phone.  Our room's phone was not working.  We reported it a number of times and they did nothing.  Entire stay without phone to reception.  Then the food. This is México.  One of the most recognized cuisines in the world for its breadth and depth of flavors.  Food in the hotel was stale.  Some looked dubious so we decided to not eat some.  We ended up having breakfast at nearby Real de Minas instead.  Then the bill.  We were double charged for drinks in two separate bills for the same seating.  Be aware as it seems common practice.  Don't let the reception staff tell you they are separate business when you complain.  They are not.  They took care of the overcharge but we had to press.  Then the service.  We complained about our shower, phone, double bill, towels, and asked for board games.  In all these occasions we faced a very friendly ""we will take care of it"" but no results.

Our room was dirty and the shower wouldn’t drain leaving you to stand in dirty shower water. The carpet hadn’t been vacuumed. At first, I thought I was seeing mold, but when I looked closer, the floor was littered with vegetation of some type- these little dark colored berry looking things. As they weren’t crawling, I counted my lucky stars. The bathroom was horrible- dirty, not functional. Shower wouldn’t drain. Just yucky. Front desk was not inclined to be helpful and were not responsive.   I would encourage management to offer retraining on customer service, housekeeping staff needs to learn how to properly clean a room and maintenance needs to unplug the plumbing. Lastly, this place needs a thorough cleaning - top to bottom with bleach!  On the bright side, the bed slept good and the food was good, but I figured the kitchen was like my room-dirty. Yuck.

The area us pretty new, said that, there is a Holiday Inn Express almost in front, which I believe will be a lot better.  Service in general very bad. It seems that there is no training at all. Very old, smells old. You can get a better hotel at the same price with better service and quality. Don’t stay there, even if it is free, unless you like suffering.

888,Travel a lot but worst experience.,1,1,2020,Jennifer,"I recently tried to stay at this hotel. Nice location in the center of Guanajuato but when we called about parking Sergio told us that the parking was across the street and 40 pesos a day. We also asked about cancellation because we were with other people and tried to book the day before we left. He also said you don’t pay until you get to the hotel. So, we booked and went. When we got there the hotel was in a side street going up a hill that was blocked by a large amount of traffic, and the parking was a “6 minute drive”. With traffic probably looked like 20 mins. For this we asked to cancel. Itzali the front desk said she would take care of it because we had told her about the cancellation. We still got charged 4 rooms for a night and they tried to charged me something else. After trying to speak to many employees, the booking website and even the hotel manager they didn’t want to return our money. Long story short if they’re just trying to take your money I’m not staying.…","Responded Jan 13, 2020","Response from mesoncuevano, Gerente at Meson CuevanoResponded Jan 13, 2020","1. How would we tell our guests that parking is ""across the street"", knowing it isn't even close to that? It doesn´t make sense, we would have discussions upon all arrivals and this site would be full of negative comments. 2. You booked on booking.com, and it is announced that we do not have parking. By the way, also on our website. 3. When you arrived, we offered you our help to guide you to the parking, but where ignored. 4. After you asked to cancel, you where adviced by message that there might be cancellation costs. You saw the message but ignored it. 5. As stated on your reservation form you received from booking.com, there is a full charge on No Shows. We only charged you - not even completely - the first night (we could have charged both nights, following strictly the booking.com cancellation policy). 6. It's not fair to blame us for mistakes you did. It's even sarcastic to say that we are ""just trying to take your money"" considering the help we offered you, considering we didn't charge the full amount and considering you where adviced previously and upon arrival about the cancellation policy. To our future guests, don't hesitate in contacting us for any doubts, we are always doing our best to help you around. We are located right in the heart of the Centro Histórico. Guanajuato city center with it's tunnels and small streets is complicated and (almost all) hotels in that area do not have their own parking."

Wifi was decent and the bathroom had good hot water and toiletries.  Front desk is friendly and helpful with good service overall.  A continental breakfast comes with the room.  Fruits and breads mostly.  I did not partake during my stay.  It is centrally located within walking distance of all of the sites in the city.  I will say the bed was what I would call ""Mexican Hard"", basically slightly softer than a rock with little give when you jump on it.  This is not unusual in Mexico.  It may take some getting used to if you have not experienced that.  If you don't like hard beds, probably not a good place for you to stay.  Also, there was some noise from the street and the breakfast room in the morning (my room was next door), though that would likely be typical of all hotels in the center of town.  Guanajuato is a delight.

896,Perfect for me,4,1,2017,Margaret234,"I have nothing but praise for my five-day stay at Hotel Real de Minas in Guanajuato in February 2016. My room was on the third floor facing the street. I had a narrow, but adequate balcony for 1-2 people. The view from the balcony was limited; however, I have read other reviews that the upper floors have much better views of the city, which is especially nice at night when the city lights up. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. It was also quiet, day and night. Granted, it was off-season, so I cannot comment about the noise during peak seasons. The staff could not of have been nicer and more accommodating - from the front desk, to housekeeping, to the restaurant personal. The restaurant is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The selection of appetizers, entrées, and desserts is ample, and the food is delicious, My only reason for giving 4 stars is that the location is a bit far from the center of town (about 15-20 minutes on foot), but for someone like me who likes to walk, it's fine.

If you didn't want to pay for a taxi every time you went somewhere, then you had to walk over a kilometre each way along a highway.  My other problem with this hotel was that it's not very well-maintained. One of the couples on the tour I was on had a blocked sink when they arrived. This was promptly fixed, unlike the problem I had with my room, which was that only three of the six lights actually worked. This was a problem because the bulbs were of such low wattage that even the fully-lit rooms were gloomy.  When I asked someone to come and fix the lights, the guy they sent up turned on the (non-functioning) light switch with a flourish, as if to say ""See, it works!"" It didn't. He replaced one of the three light bulbs. When I asked about the others, his reply was ""mañana"". Mañana came and went and my other lights were never replaced.

We decided to head to the restaurant in the evening and it wasn't crowded, but did see a group of about 10 seated. After being seated and waiting for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged, we asked one of the employees for a waiter and were told that due to the large group, it would be awhile before we'd get our food.  After that, not a single server came by to even offer a menu or take our drink orders.  I seriously felt like we were completely invisible.  We decided to go off property to get food.     As for the hotel, the beds were extremely hard, as another reviewer mentioned, we could hear lots of noise through the walls and the wi-fi did not work at all.

I was very dissappointed with the food at Pacific and the steak house. 4 meals and 4 drinks were $500 and definitely not exceptional, think pasta and fish. We did not dine at Nobu. The Playabar had good food as did the wedding we attended. When weather prevented wedding guests from being able to fly in, they were charged for all 3 nights. That’s poor customer service as these were people that would consider staying there at a later date and the storms were not their fault.  The weather was freeizng day and night. So no pool or beach. One friend went to front desk for a blanket and they told her to go buy one from the gift shop. It is only when she said they were out at the shop they gave her one. Beautiful facility and great service. It’s way out, so you have to take a 30 minutes taxi or eat there.

928,"Fantastic wedding venue, but, as a hotel, not so much",3,6,2022,rex179,"The pacific side of the baja is quite blustery and cold.  As a dramatic backdrop for a beautify wedding, it is inspiring.  But to swim or lounge on the beach would be a fool's errand.  We never saw any Nobu patron on the beach or in any of the pools!   The ediface of the hotel is impressive and kept immaculately clean of blowing sand. However, the rooms have no heat, so my wife slept in her bathrobe to keep from freezing (in June). If you're OK paying $7 for a donut at the coffee shop or $50 for a small helping of fish and chips, the prices won't scare you.  Make sure to check the cancelation policy.  Early checkouts are met with this: once you're in, you're stuck, whether you're happy or not or you leave early or not. In our case, Nobu promised but never delivered a space heater to our room.  That's all it would have taken for us to be satisfied that they cared. Instead, when we checked out early, they just thumbed their noses.  Doing it over, we would definitely attend the wedding functions, which were great.  Another hotel, preferably on the Cabo side of the baja (better weather), would be our choice.…",Responded yesterday,"Response from Hector Varela, Propietario at Nobu Hotel Los CabosResponded yesterday","Dear rwt179,   First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us through this very important platform.

I read a lot of reviews before booking. Unless something changed with the food and drinks after reading the reviews before we booked I am not sure why some people were complaining.   My wife and I are pretty picky when it comes to food. The food was so good. You have to try the Italian food at Pergola, we ate there twice. The selection of food was very good. Also we loved the food at Sake restaurant, the sushi rolls were very good too. The drinks everywhere were very good and they didn’t skimp on the alcohol either. We also enjoyed Suspiro bar after dinner to watch the different NBA, NHL and MLB games going on the big screen TVs, great atmosphere. We were there the first week of June 2022 and it was not very crowded so we didn’t have to wait on food or drinks for very long after ordering.  We had an ocean front room. The room and bed were very comfortable. We loved ordering room service and eating breakfast or a late night snack out on our balcony listening to the waves hitting the shoreline. The weather was very nice so we left our sliding door open at night to sleep with the ocean sound in the background, it was very relaxing.

If not out of room before noon, no housekeeping is done unless you call.  None of our requests at time of booking and several calls after were honored. Finally got a manager to put our family at least in the same building after being told three times prior to arriving that we were all together. Booked a package with free breakfast and kids eat free. Had to go to check in desk every day to adjust bill for this.  Very limited food choices. No selection at deli. Lobby bar not kid friendly. Only choice is Nak bar and grill.

942,Incredible resort with amazing staff!,5,1,2022,Leeanne Weld Kostopoulos,"My family and I have just returned from a three week stay at Grand Velas in Los Cabos. I had a certain amount of concern having not stayed in many all-inclusive places, and certainly not in one as big as Grand Velas, but we all thought that the accommodation, facilities, and setting were first rate. More particularly, the food offered in the different restaurants was excellent and plentiful. Each of the chefs at the restaurants went out of their way to create special meals for us and ensure that they had what we wanted to eat, given the length of our stay. More than anything, the staff at Grand Velas were what makes the place all super friendly, and aiming to please. The last comment would be on value, for what we received, and with all the other research that we had done about other hotels and resorts, I don't think the value can be beat. The only knock on Cabo is the fact that you can't swim in the water because of the undertow, but at least if you're interested in walking the beach, there's miles after miles to do that.…","Responded Jan 31, 2022","Response from Andreas Schmidt, Director General at Grand Velas Los CabosResponded Jan 31, 2022","Leeanne, it was quite an honor for us to have you and your lovely family reside at our beautiful resort for three weeks of sunshine and bliss.

945,Great Resort,5,6,2022,Brook B,What a wonderful resort. I would say the thing that made this trip most enjoyable was our concierge Michelle. She has been very helpful and our stay here more enjoyable. Sunday we tested for Covid. My wife and friends tested negative. I tested positive for Covid and my wife and our other couple were able to fly home as planned. I was kindly escorted into a different part of the hotel and put under quarantine. Michelle has gone out of her way to check on me every day and to make it as pleasant as possible for me to be here she is definitely a valuable employee. She got my meals to my room in a very timely manner. Made sure I didn't need anything many times. She truly made me feel like she cared. If it wasn't for her my stay here at this hotel would be a lot different opinion. Please thank her for her kindness and taking care of me.

947,Great vacation!,5,6,2021,Alexandrea S,"Originally, I posted a negative review on day 4 of our 10 day stay, because of issues with reservations for dinner and the pool cabana. However, Lazalo, the Guest Services Manager, contacted us immediately, got the information and corrected it! It is now day 8 and we are having so much fun.  The restaurants are good and offer a variety good for adults and kids. More importantly for parents, the bars and drinks are 👍💯 Alberto at Mole (Mexican restaurant), Luis at Capella (Italian), Amir & Alexis poolside service, Kenny at the swim up bar, and Alex, our concierge, are awesome.  We recommend the grilled octopus, fish ceviche and tuna tostada at Gabi (restaurant at pool & pool service). The vampiro taco at Mole 😋 The kids have been eating the hot dogs and chicken the whole time and no complaints 🙏 Breakfast room service 👍👍 Ricardo & Jennifer, the photographers are so good and worth the 💵 We got gorgeous family photos.

949,Relaxing,5,6,2022,KAAV,"We just stayed here for a week and had an awesome time. We have stayed at other all inclusive resorts and the food here is by far the best food of any resort we have stayed at. We had booked a ocean front swim out suite and wow was it worth it!! With the swim out suite you are in the reserve area and that made the trip even more relaxing. In the pictures we weren’t sure if it would be busy in front of our room with other guests coming to the reserve pool but it was quiet and peaceful, a plus that this area is adults only and if you want to be around more guests or commotion you can go to the main pool.  Pros-  -The food was amazing  -The swimmable beach was nice to spend time at and sit in the water very relaxing  -The reserve area made everything so relaxing and worry free  -The beds are comfortable and room service multiple times a day to maintain a clean room  -Various entertainment at night but definitely not a huge party scene if that is what you are looking for  Cons- -Nothing drastic that would alter our experience the good out weighs any minor inconveniences   We had some great interactions with staff members that made our trip memorable, Francisco is the man and will make you any speciality drink you can think of and is delicious. Jorge was awesome for tequila tasting, and any recommendations for pairing alcohol to compliment your meal. Arim and Javier at the swim out pool were very accommodating and ensured we had drinks or food all day. Isabel and Miguel at the La Palapa restaurant were so kind and awesome every morning.

954,Stunning Resort!,4,6,2022,just_moe,"We stayed in unit 7301, a 2 bedroom, 3rd floor, building 7 overlooking the kids pool and the back of the Royal Solaris. The resort is ultra clean and chic – bright white walls with dark wood accents and the most incredible  “rope art installations” in the lobby and pool restaurant Flor de Noche. Rooms are huge, well-appointed with comfortable beds, full kitchen and huge tub in the primary suite. The resort itself is the perfect size, spacious but with a boutique, classy feel, and plenty of options to chill by the pool or beach. Service was excellent -Adrian Cesena and Jesus Castro providing amazing service during our stay. Their hard work made us feel like royalty! Housekeeping serviced our room 3x per day and did an incredible job as well.  We ate at Flor de Noche many times and our favorites were pastor tacos and shrimp ceviche, with refreshing cucumber margaritas. This resort is in good proximity to restaurants and about 1 mile to grocery stores La Comer and Chedraui. La Comer was the cleanest, nicest grocery store I’ve ever been to and we walked there on our first day and took a taxi back to the resort for $7 to stock our kitchen for the week. Taxi fees to groceries, or downtown SJDC $7, Marina $20, Flora Farms $25 each way.  Uber was tough to schedule from the hotel zone, as the transportation inspectors were posted at nearly every hotel driveway each day. If you have reservations somewhere, easiest to catch a taxi to arrive on time vs uncertainty of Uber showing up. …",Responded 4 days ago,"Response from Diamond Resorts, Atención al huésped/Recepción at Cabo Azul ResortResponded 4 days ago","Thank you so much for such a complete review.

955,My favorite hotel in Cabo!,4,6,2022,bonique e,"I'm going to start with a few details that were missing and then explain why this hotel is one of the best in Cabo!    1) The bottled water is $9 and that is more than a galloon of gas 2) They don't provide water to brush your teeth or to use at the coffee machine.  This is silly.   If water is  filtered and doesn't require bottled water, then signage should be placed.  3) They charge a resort fee, but many times, the pool station was out of towels or house keeping did not return after a few hours.  (Not sure why housekeeping doesn't use tablets to keep track of their rooms?) 4) The resident restaurant is incredibly overpriced and lacks flavor  NOW let's get to the awesome stuff 1) The décor is unparalleled.  They combine old with new architecture and its dreamy!   You want to stay forever! 2) They have planks on the sand, so its easier to walk to your cabana 3) They don't upsell cabanas and chairs.  It's simply first come, first serve and every guest is treated like an equal 4) There are multiple pool areas to accommodate families with kids or adult only spaces. 5) The location is walkable and doesn't have the ""Spring Break"" vibe if you want to relax 6) Multiple English speaking TV stations and the staff speaks fluent English 7) The texting system for hotel assistance is lovely and easy to use 8) The location felt incredibly safe…",Responded 4 days ago,"Response from Diamond Resorts, Atención al huésped/Recepción at Cabo Azul ResortResponded 4 days ago",We are so pleased to hear all your highliths of your stay and the facilities because there is no doubt that you had the kind of service that our Team Members strive to offer.

We wanted to upgrade from a Jr Suite to a one bedroom but their was no availability. Since no one was allowed to go in the ocean, we had to stay poolside or on the beach. Pools, pools, pools, were everywhere. Jacuzzis also. The loungers and cabanas were plentiful if you are an early riser to select your perfect location. The pool menu was limited but convenient.

957,Average resort,3,6,2022,jal3137,I would say this is an average resort. Everything is decorated in a bit of an outdated way - brown everywhere. So not a modern colorful or modern grey/white look. No way to reserve a cabana so get ready for the deal where everyone takes the (limited) shade and then you can't use the spot that no one ever sat in.  Food was not flavorful and a pretty limited menu EXCEPT Javiers (dinner only). That was a gorgeous space and delicious food.  Food service at pool always friendly but not enough people working and menu was very limited. ,Responded 1 week ago,"Response from Diamond Resorts, Atención al huésped/Recepción at Cabo Azul ResortResponded 1 week ago","We appreciate that you have taken a moment to share your feedback, please note that we will share your comments with the Team as an improvement opportunity and will be pleased to welcome you back in the future.

Big comfy balcony which overlooked the parking area and resort next door which was great as we had a rental car and could come and go as we wished using the exit to lot vs front entrance.   Room was fully stocked with all appliances and amenities, The blender got a lot of use for my Mango Daiquiris.  We stayed for 2 weeks, it was nice having our own kitchen to make some of our own meals and snacks, 2 different grocery stores a couple miles away…Chedraui and La Comer….we went to both.      Pools outstanding with numerous seating arrangements.  The main pool is composed of 3 cascading pools flowing toward beach area. The top level is heated. Numerous hot tub areas, Serenity pools x2 near front and a childrens pool on the property.  The beach is beautiful but not swimmable…make sure you get out there for sunrise.  The service at the pools are great even offering cool towels to refresh.       We ate poolside from restaurant tacos, pizza, guacamole, which all were good just as you can expect resort prices.   We also had coffee and pastries from the Starbucks on site.

The beds were not the most comfy but worked after traveling all day. The staff were nice. The restaurant was decent and there’s a Starbucks across the road.

We booked two rooms, called the hotel to confirm they had adjoining rooms. They confirmed. When we checked in they could only find one room. After 30+ minutes of arguing the unpleasant and unhelpful Sofia found our reservation. Got to our rooms, not only did they smell musty and like stale cigarettes and hookers, but They were not adjoining. Went back to the front desk to be told the hotel does not offer adjoining rooms. After more arguing we were supposedly issued a refund. We travel frequent hour 4 children and this is hands down the worst customer service I have ever received.

I dined at their second floor restaurant on Saturday, my credit card was hacked 99 charges totaling over $5,000, unbeknownst to me until Monday morning.  Monday night I checked at the bell desk about a shuttle to the airport Tuesday morning for my girl, I was told not a problem.  Tuesday morning the bell desk told me, they don't offer shuttle service to the airport. The bell desk provided me a shuttle to the airport Saturday night to the airport to pick up my girl.  Different shifts, different rules???  The pool is heated, but good luck getting pool towels, I waited over an hour for housekeeping to deliver towels as they aren't provided freely at the pool.

Before staying at this hotel I read the reviews, most of the reviews are about how horrible the service is. I figured it was just some uptight people writing some bad reviews but after staying here I realized that it true. My first complaint was when someone walked into my room. The hotel double booked my room, I really don’t know how this happened but I really did not like that. The clerk said it will not happen again. So I thought. My second complaint was when it happened again. This time I’m pissed. So I decided to talk to the manager and ask what’s going on. While talking to the manager I’m getting the feeling like he thinks I just wanted something for free, so he tells me the 2 drinks at the bar are free. Lol, I don’t want free stuff. I want privacy.

972,Worst Winery at Valle,1,4,2022,Victor A,"I went to el Cielo @ Valle with my Family, I didn’t like it , we selected the basic wine tasting because we only wanted to stay for a short time. After staying on the terrace for about 15 minutes. I wanted to order a beer , so I went in order a beer at the cocktail bar , I DOUBLE CHECKED with the bartender and waitress if I could bring the beer to the terrace and they said, no problem!, I returned to my table with my beer and less than 5 minutes, the manager came and asked me to move to the bar because I couldnt have a beer at the terrace, because the terrace was only for wine. I told him that their staff assure me I could ,before purchasing the beer. I left the place because I felt they were too rigid. Don’t waste your time and money on this place, they don’t t seem to care about their customers.

975,Beautiful resort but some services are way overpriced!,4,3,2022,danielswiss64,"We stayed for five nights.  The hotel is very nice.  Our room really looked beautiful and was well stocked.  However, furniture in the rooms is cheap and won’t last long before showing wear and tear.  Pool was not able to be used or heated even though I was told it would be open.  Room service and clean up was inconsistent.  Sometimes things were replaced.  Sometimes not.  Views over the vineyards is gorgeous.  Restaurants are pretty good.  Wine is good too.  They overcharge a lot for getting any local transportation.  That was very annoying.  They booked us in a very small car for four people and it got stuck in the mud and we never made it to the restaurant and had to be pulled out by a friendly stranger.  They were going to charge 75.00 for this transport but eventually the price was $45.00.

First, the cheap flimsy blanket was too small for the bed.  So you wake up multiple times to find everything bunched.  This trivial economy is baffling for a hotel that aspires to be called elegant.  Second, the maximum temperature in the shower was barely tepid.  The bed and the shower are the key amenities for me.

988,Unfortunate Demise,2,5,2022,NicoVas1,"Poor Managnent, I have been staying here since it opened over 30 years ago. I have seen management come and go. It's time for this one to go  First they no longer have room service or food service to the pool or the bar terrace which has the best view on the property. They have cut thier dinner menu to a handful of items. No quesadillas, enchiladas, flautas, nothing appetizing. Basically service and caring about guest is no longer a concern of theirs. They now sell terrible pizza for 14 dollars. I have tasted better frozen pizza. The outdoor jacuzzi doesn't work. They require a 10 cash deposit for pool towels. They aren't able to charge the deposit to your account. So no cash no towels. They provide one flat pillow per guest. You're unable to comfortably watch television.

I only brought one large heavy bag thank goodness walking up and down 4 flights of stairs is not cool and definitely not cool in high heels!  There is no room service and after traveling a long day I was tired, it was late and there was no food and no room service.  After this long day I wanted to take a nice bath and lay down....THE PROBLEM....there is no tub! and furthermore, there were no wash cloths! There were two large towels and 1 hand towel for two people!    I was devastated.  I paid 100.00 more (per evening) for air conditioning.  Mistake?  not sure, but I was FREEZING and they had no extra blankets or pillows in the closet.  The next day comes I was on my way to a Mothers Day Brunch, needed to iron.....BUT GUESS WHAT!  Yup, no iron in the closet.  Over all...the unaccommodating features of this place is why I would not stay here or recommend this place.

993,Ocean views are beautiful and the staff was great.,4,4,2022,Gary,"I struggled rating this resort hotel.  The entire facility could use some renovation. The windows in my villa with a beautiful ocean view, all needed to be cleaned. That said, however, my room was clean and room service took very good care of me. Particularly after I tipped her on the first day of a four night stay. The pools were fun and the indoor pool is very nice on an overcast, marine layer day. The staff was very nice. The bartender very good and friendly. (He spoke very little English, but that was not a problem.) There were 18 of us in the group, including teenagers and small children. (All friends and family.) Everyone had a great time. The young kids loved the mini zoo, despite the smell of the Korean pigs. The lady at the mini zoo was so nice, she showed the kids baby bunnies with their eyes still closed and how to feed all of the animals. The  hotel restaurant, that is all buffet, was pretty good and had a large variety, and the staff went out of their way to service you. It's an easy walk to Lobster Village with all of the shops and restaurants. Also an easy walk to CaliMex, the local grocery store. I had a kitchenette in my room, so after the first day I cooked breakfast each morning. (I wanted at least one low calorie, high protein meal for the day.) If the facility underwent some renovations, I would give it a 5 star rating. We all had a great time, did not want to leave and would go back again.

1004,Excellent location !,4,1,2020,pixiee70,"This place has potential for sure.  It’s modern, clean, our experience with the service was good.  The rooms are simple, very small but you can’t beat the location. Easy access from border. Walking distance to Zona rio or the revolution.  Across the street from tacos el franc.  8th floor so great view. Covered parking.  Hotel felt secure.   Note to housekeeping, need to clean the grouting!! Otherwise the room was clean.  The bed however is uncomfortable, we woke up so sore. But everything else was great so that’s why the 4 stars.   We’ll still try another place next time though only because of the bed.","Responded Aug 22, 2020","Response from Julian Palomo, General Manager at Ibis Tijuana Zona RioResponded Aug 22, 2020","Estimado Huésped,  Muchas Gracias por su comentario positivo acerca de nuestro hotel!

1010,Victor M. “The Butler” Top notch service!,5,6,2022,Deacon78,"Sooo wife and I ventured to El Garza Blanca to celebrate 10yr anniversary. Upon arrival to the airport we were notified that OUR LUGGAGE WAS STILL IN THE STATES!!!  So after hours of waiting to see if our luggage would arrive the following day! Nothing we could do bout it so we headed to the resort. Upon arriving I notified the front desk about our luggage issue and that the Airport was supposed to deliver it to our hotel. Called the airport to clarify but of course they had no idea what I was talking about even though the lady at the airport told us it would be delivered…  Later that day I received a call from Victor M. Who introduced himself as our butler. I told him about the luggage situation…he contacted the airport,called me back and told me he would have our luggage by 1pm!  12:22 the next day Victor not only had our luggage but sent a pic to verify they were correct bags , Then delivered our bags to our room! May not mean much to others reading this but if you have ever been in another country without your personal belongings then you know my pain!    Not only did Victor go beyond exceptional service the whole time we were there he checked on us making sure we didn’t want for nothing! Then he offered and setup a rose petals bubble bath/ champagne setting for our room while we were out….Vic you the MAN!!!

1011,We Loved the Hard Rock Los Cabos,5,1,2021,gkm58,"Just returned from a one week family vacation at the Hard Rock Los Cabos. It was husband, wife and two  teenagers. We have stayed at close to 20 all inclusive resorts across Mexico, Jamaica, Turks Caicos and the Bahamas. This was our first stay at a Hard Rock Resort.   First off, the service and personnel were top notch. Virtually everyone we encountered was pleasant, accommodating and very professional. Any requests we had were happily accommodated. On top of that, the hotel would follow-up with us to make sure our expectations were met. I always felt the staff wanted to make sure we were having a nice time.   The hotel was beautiful and clean. The pools were very nice, and provided a variety of options if you wanted a more quiet experience or something more lively. Drink and food service was superb at the pools.   The restaurants were really good. We go out to dinner quite a bit at home and to very nice restaurants. We  thought the al la carte restaurants at Hard Rock were excellent. The Brazilian place was my least favorite, but maybe that was because it was our first night there and we were tired from our flight. Our order of favorites were the sushi place, steak house, Italian, Mexican, tepanyaki and Brazilian. We really liked the Mexican place for breakfast. They had several al la carte Mexican dishes that were great. Also recommend going next door to Nobu for dinner one night. It is pricey, but the food and setting for dinner at sunset is spectacular.    We enjoyed the spa services, pool tables and walking on the beach. The 24/7 coffee shop was great. They have lots of desert, sandwich, gellato and snack options. There is a nice bowling alley, but we did not try that. Beach is clean and great for walking. We saw whales everyday on our walks which was fun.   Only potential concern and we really needed to think about it, but the water temp in the pools varied from day to day. One day warm and another day not so warm, but other pools that day would be warm. Normally not a concern, but Cabo in late December and the temperatures are in the 70’s, so the warmer pool water makes a difference, particularly for the kids.   The pandemic protocols were strict, which we really appreciated. Everyone was required to wear masks, numbers limited on elevators, tables were spaced out in restaurants and sanitizing stations were everywhere.   Relative to other all inclusives we have stayed at, this was overall right near the top. Excellent property, good service and outstanding food options.…","Responded Jan 5, 2021","Response from Customer  Care HRHLC, Propietario at Hard Rock Hotel Los CabosResponded Jan 5, 2021","Hello rockstar!

1017,Beautiful but not for the thrifty at heart.,4,2,2022,Scott B,"Beautiful resort, overpriced menu.  Reconsider that upgraded all-inclusive package that is over $100.00 per day per person because they will get that and more out of you if stay there and think you can eat and drink by buying the cheapest menu items.  Unless you don't drink and eat one small meal per day you will come out ahead.  If you feel trapped you can leave to go eat but figure in a Taxi which all are $9usd w $1 usd tip = $10 one-way anywhere in town and again the same back $20 total round trip, unless of course you walk like we often did.  Then you have to find the few and far between, fairly priced non-tourist trap places to go. All of the places on the beach are double even triple priced compared to in town.  If you have deeper pockets than my thrifty bottom, you will love this place.

1035,A stressful experience,3,6,2022,Ryan S,"We arrived at Marina Fiesta on Wednesday, May 25 for 5 nights. We are owners at Hacienda Encantada; however, decided to stay here this time on the use of a certificate.  When we booked the reservation, we were guaranteed a room with a King Bed (due to certificate use), even though the copy of the certificate the resort had did not guarantee bed type.  When we arrived in the room, we found a Queen bed. We immediately called the front desk and asked for a room with a King Bed. She said they did not have any that night. She told us she would have one the next day.  The next day we went to the front desk to get our new room keys. They told us that the only king beds in the resort are in the newer remodeled rooms. They said that the type of room guaranteed to us do not even have King Beds. They charged me $160 US Dollars for the remaining 4 nights. I had to have my luggage ready for the bell staff to move, as we were going away for the day.   I later found out that is not true and some of the studio rooms do have king beds. It is also reflected on the website. That means that the front desk was lying to me. They should not have lied to me in order to get the upgrade. Either way, my stay was guaranteed to be a King Bed.   We found the staff to overall be very friendly. The room was clean and nice. It is an older resort; however, kept up very well. The reason the resort received three stars in this review are because of some of the friendly staff.  We found the bell people,  concierge, housekeeper, lobby bartender and sales reps in the lobby (Yesenia) to be extremely kind.    On the other hand, we found that there was one server at Baja Lobster that was absolutely miserable.  We also found the front desk and pool staff were not that friendly.  Other than the room type, we were shocked by some of the other issues during our stay.  The main pool is just gross. The filtration system in the pool was ""down"" during our stay. The pool has all sorts of debris, dirt and layers of sunscreen in it. One of the staff members informed us that the filtration system is down and they are working on repairing it. Therefore, the pool was not available to us.  This was disappointing as two of our five days were going to be spent only at the resort.    The restaurants on the Marina were delicious; however, we went to breakfast Monday morning at the pool and quickly lost our appetite after realizing the birds just eat off the communal spoons during the entire meal. This is not the staff's fault. They just need a better breakfast setup and a way to stop that from happening.  Also on Monday morning the power went out for several hours at the resort and we could not properly get ready for our check-out and ride to the airport.  Two times prior to departure, I tried to let the manager on duty (listed as Wendy) in the lobby know about the issues we had during our stay; however, she was unavailable both times.   When I returned, I contacted the resort and no one would contact me by phone.  They eventually returned my messages via email.  I got in touch with Wendy, who refused to refund my upgrade fee telling me that they were 100% full and they could not move me to my requested room.  Well, I feel that she was not being truthful, as she kept ignoring the fact that the front desk told me that my assigned room type did not have any King beds at all.  In addition, the front desk told me at check-in they were only about 65% full, which is quite different from what Wendy told me.  Since she was unable to resolve my issue, I asked for the issue to be forwarded to the general manager, Marco.  Wendy at first told me that he does not take care of issues like this and refused to pass the issue onto him.  Eventually, after a lot of effort, the issue was passed to him and the refund for the upgrade was issued.    She also told me in our post stay conversation that the pool filtration system was down during my stay. If it was down, that is something that absolutely should be communicated to you before or at least at the time of check-in. If they would have communicated that to me, I would have asked to stay at the sister property during my stay. Nothing was mentioned about it. When it was brought to there attention, they consistently say ""it should be fixed shortly"" and it wasn't fixed my entire stay.  Trust me, you would not have wanted to get into that pool.  The resort also  had no interest in addressing the resort wide power outage with me.  The total experience was very stressful.  What they should have done was immediately refunded the upgrade fee without all of the added stress and technically they should have offered me a discounted or free stay in the future, since the pool was unavailable during my stay.  This just shows that they lack customer service.  If you look at my profile, you will see that the overwhelming number of my reviews are mostly positive.  I am shocked that they have no interest in helping the customers, even the ones that have a valid concern.…",Responded 4 days ago,"Response from  , Propietario at Marina Fiesta Resort & SpaResponded 4 days ago","Dear Ryan S,  We're sorry to hear your stay wasn't 100% pleasant, we offer you an apology for the inconvenient, we really appreciate you took a few minutes to share your experience thru this review.

1038,Disappointing 😕,2,5,2022,bronte b,"Let me start off by saying me and my boyfriend were so excited to stay here during our summer break. However, the biggest problem we had was when the front desk tried to overcharge us during checkout. They wanted us to pay for both transportation services to and from the airport, excursions, and covid testing twice. we paid for it already online through the marina fiesta’s website before we even came but they wanted us to pay again. then they tried to make us pay for a no show reservation fee at baja lobster even though we never ate there and are allergic to shellfish 😂 other guests told us they were also overcharged during checkout so if you stay here double triple check your receipts and make sure you clarify what each added charge is. I was also told in an email and while booking the room i could get 100$ resort credit. they said since i booked early i saved 10% and was not eligible for that and they gave me $40 spa credit which could only be used on the 50 or 90 minute massage.  the service was very poor. me and my boyfriend noticed our presence was always disregarded. if we sat down the waiters would help other people before us that had come after us and they would go up to people at the pool and asked them if they needed anything but they would not do the same for us even though we were tipping. We constantly had to go up to waiters/bartenders reminding them we were still here and needed something and we would be ignored for several minutes while they were assisting people who again asked for help after us. our first day we waited for the bartender by the swim up bar for almost 30 minutes, he looked over at us constantly but would not assist us, and by the time he came to help us it was last call… the swim up bar closes at 6:30 even though the pool is open until 9, the kitchen also closes early, and all inclusive does not include room service so you have to go to one of the restaurants that are technically offsite. AND at the restaurants their speciality items are not included for all inclusive. You can also only get your mini fridge in your room restocked once a day and they offer no snacks. You are also not allowed to bring food to your room, or bring back leftovers from their all inclusive restaurants.  our room was OK. the mirror we were given was broken and would not light up when plugged in. The outlet behind the nightstand was broken so i couldn’t charge my phone on my side of the bed and the light fixture on the wall was broken and would flicker all night long.  Despite all this, the bellboys, concierge, and workers in the lobby were super helpful and friendly. they deserve 5 stars alone. Shoutout to Carlos, Miguel, and Alondra. This is a beautiful resort but they need to improve their customer service. The service and all inclusive offers were extremely disappointing and we will not be coming back to this hotel in the future or recommending it to friends and family.…",Responded 1 week ago,"Response from  , Propietario at Marina Fiesta Resort & SpaResponded 1 week ago","Dear Brontebrewer,  First , We really appreciate that you took the time to leave us your personal opinion about your recent stay, Is my regret to read that you went through some inconveniences during your stay with us; I assure you that the circumstances you described are not typical with the high standards that we strive to provide.

1051,All-Inclusive Experience,5,6,2022,Rebekah T,"We searched high and low for experiences about the all-inclusive option at Villa del  Palmar, so I thought I'd write one.  First and foremost, the all-inclusive is WORTH IT.  My husband and I planned all sorts of scenarios in advance to see if we could max out the price before we went, adding up meal and drink expenses.  Before we went, it really seemed like it was 50/50 on the value.  However, after staying there, it was well worth the value.   We likely ate more and more expensive meals than we would have if we had not paid for the all-inclusive, but it was worth getting to try some of the more expensive foods.    For breakfast, we at at Bella California every morning - breakfast buffet style with traditional and local flavors.  For dinner, we ate at Bella California, Carbon Grill, the Sportsgrill,  the Pizzaria and El Patron (at sister resort).  All had a variety of foods, very tasty.  For lunch, we at the pool bar every day. Alcoholic drinks are free with the all-inclusive.  And they are NOT chintzy with the alcohol.  I watched them make Long Island Iced teas multiple times and they were very generous with the pours.  I had a Paloma at the server's recommendation (Fresca, tequila, and lime juice), a local favorite, it was very good, I ended up drinking it most often.  At the restaurants, the house wines are free, others are available for a discounted price with the all-inclusive.  They offer a variety of beers that are included in the all-inclusive too. We had read a bit that the waiters are inattentive to guests on the all-inclusive plan and we found that was NOT true.  At least 50% of the guests I saw were on the all-inclusive (indicated by colored bracelet) and the attendants were very attentive.  We also had a FABULOUS pool bar attendant all week, NICO, who hustled and really worked hard for all the guests.  We ended up ordering 2 drinks at a time, so that we gave him a break from always serving us, and he got used to what we ordered and sometimes would just bring drinks in advance.  He was absolutely great and really made our week. Even though tips are included in the all-inclusive, they are spread out across all workers of the resort, so we did tip our waiters a smaller fraction than we normally would so that they received a direct tip from us.  Even with that in consideration, my husband and I save over $500 together when we compared what we would have spent on all the food and drink if we had not paid for the all-inclusive (yes, we kept all the receipts and added it up like nerds). We did stay at this property 16 years ago, and it had been remodeled in that time.  The rooms were very nice, all tile, great balcony, big shower, and great kitchen area for cooking, if that's your preference.  There is a Costco downtown that you can purchase food at and cook all week, which we have done before at other resorts, which is a cost-effective choice also.  There is a 2-burner stove and very large fridge in the kitchen.  They also have smaller appliances (toaster and blender) for convenience.   Finally, when my husband and I checked in, there was a mix-up and we got a room with 2 queen beds.  We visited the front desk to determine if there was a king room available.  We were told there wasn't, but the attendant (SMITH) would see.  He came back with a room in building 1, which was a VERY NICE room, with a great view of the ocean.  It was definitely an upgrade from the room we were originally given.  Maid service was also wonderful, with a visit 3 times a day to make, clean and turn down the bed.  Overall, a wonderful stay.  The only negative I noted was that they used a higher exchange rate on the dollar than the daily rate we were seeing at the bank.  So when you convert your bills to dollars, it's higher than if they were using the bank rate.  However, if you can choose to pay in pesos…",Responded 4 days ago,"Response from Gaby  Galindo, Atención al huésped/Recepción at Villa del Palmar Beach Resort & Spa Cabo San LucasResponded 4 days ago","Dear 287rebekaht  Thank you for expressing your great satisfaction with Villa del Palmar Beach Resort & Spa Cabo San Lucas and for sharing the details of your stay with us.

1053,Family All-inclusive Trip,5,6,2022,Ryan Lewis,"This was our first all-inclusive trip at Villa del Palmar and found it to be worth it if you plan on staying on the resort the majority of the time.  The breakfast buffet is generally what you'd expect but be prepared to guard your food from the birds. As long as you don't leave your table unattended you should be ok but they aren't scared to hop on your table and grab your breakfast.  During the day time we spent our time by the pool and I can't stress how great Nico was. Every day he took care of us, constantly in a very fast walk or jog to make sure everyone was taken care of. He was very friendly and quickly learned our go to drinks and would check with us every time he walked by. He definitely made the trip for us with his hospitality.  We setup dinner reservations for each night the week before but left 2 nights open. We would probably change this in the future and have a reservation each night. Our off nights we had pizza from the pizza bar and Sports grill. Their food quality isn't bad but it's not up to par as the reservation required restaurants. One thing I would say is be prepared sometimes for lengthy meals as the food would take a bit to come and you don't need to be shy to ask for ""la cuenta.""

1054,"8 days -great location, cold pool— will go back",4,6,2022,Jennie B,"Great Location …… I have stayed in Cabo several times although usually we get a condo in the beach or stay at a all inclusive like RIU.  This time we wanted to go out for dinner nightly.  We stayed 8 nights at Tosoro and loved it.    Location- (5). Awesome you can walk to local shopping, amazing restaurants and bars.  Take a water taxi or e curation easily.  Uber is the best way to go anywhere not taxi. Make sure your credit card has no international fees to save more.   Pool service  (5). was great with Sara and her team   Pool. (2).  it was way too cold first few days only a few kids were In pool.   kids over ran the hot tubs because the pool was too cold.  They had their pool floatie a, tubes and squirt guns in the spa.  Annoying.  It was a little warmer towards the end of our week. But only a degree or two.   Rooms (2). (4). We had two rooms. We hated our first room. Located at the very end of the other building away from the pool.  You had to walk up a full flight of narrow stairs to our room.  Note my mom was with me and has an artificial knee and 79 years old.   I asked when reserving if they had elevators, but they neglected to tell me there are no elevators to the fourth floor.   They did move us and it was much better. Beds were very comfortable.   Food (5). Breakfast buffet was the best all inclusive breakfast. Very good. I let station, beans. Rice. Fruit cereal, and so in.    Dinner/lunch was normal pool food. Not bad. Fair prices   Drinks were great. Pool service staff lead by Sara was amazing.   Overall we loved the hotel and location. Staff was friendly.  Only downside was pool was super cold.  Many people refused to get in because it was too cold in JUNE We did a day pass at another hotel and their pool was at least 10-20 degrees warmer   Local restaurants. John’s across street had excellent coconut shrimp. Service was great ine night and not so good the next night. Our favorite restaurant was Cabo Cantina. Not even a block away.  Tacos, fajitas, soup, and shrimp!

Our AC did go out for the last couple days, but the hotel itself is so breezy that the fan above the bed was enough for it to feel super cool when sleeping. I didn't enjoy when some of the guests were permitted to sit by the pool bar on the stair entrance into the pool and chainsmoke. If you wanted to get into the pool you had to walk through it, cough cough.  That might be something staff should tell guests they can't do, even if no one else complains.

1069,Amazing experience!,5,5,2022,Danielle W,My boyfriend and I were here for a week and there was an issue with one of the buildings when we arrived so they upgraded us and sent us to Playa Grande (another resort they own) for two nights till we could make it back to Solmar. They were nice about it and did everything they could to make up for it. Everyone was very energetic and really prioritized making sure we had a great time. Rodolpho did an amazing job keeping the energy up around the pool and it was so much fun participating in the activities he planned. Our favorite morning server was Alexus. He did everything he could to make sure we were satisfied with our time spent at the restaurant. Overall though Uriel really made our stay as enjoyable as it was. Our first night we came to Tejaban (the resultant on campus) he was our server and was really the reason we decided to go back there every night. It was really nice to walk in an have someone know exactly what you like and accommodate to your wants and needs. He was very attentive and seemed like he was having a genuinely good time when he came by our tables. And never held back on bringing us more drinks! Just be aware that if you look up the resort on your own the pictures usually show Grand Solmar and not Solmar. Solmar is much smaller and if you have the all inclusive with one you can’t get the benefits of all inclusive at the other. We had an amazing stay nonetheless and would love to come back!

1071,Absolutely Brutal.  Akin to theft.,1,4,2022,Rob C,"My family of four came to Cabo from La Paz because we had some business to attend to. I combed the internet for a good all inclusive option because we were going to be on a bus for 3.5 hours and then had to leave in the early morning for a meeting and I didn't want the hassle of having to find a spot to eat with with 2 small kids and our busy schedules.  I looked at a few hotels but settled on the solmar as the all inclusive option.  I was very careful to book the link that stated meals were included and chose to book it through Agoda although all of the third party affiliates were the same price and had the same all inclusive packages. I am nerotic about booking hotels or trips and was very thorough in choosing the correct options.    Upon arriving with my tired and hungry family we were told by both the managers Gerardo and Michael at the reception desk that our booking was not all inclusive and that we had to ""add it on"" for another $225usd.  I told him he must be mistaken and that meals were very clearly included when I paid online as that was my prerequisite for the booking.    Gerardo proceeded to rudely and condescendingly give me a receipt that said NON REFUNDABLE then told me to cancel the booking with Agoda, then he could recharge me to provide the service I paid for....knowing full well that would double the cost.  I was shocked at the suggestion.   At no time did they take accountability for the fact that they had a customer who paid for a service that was not being supplied. Instead they found it in thier best interest to argue with me stating that it was agodas fault and therefore it was my problem or the third party booking. I explained they are affiliated with the company representing them so they should honor the arrangement.  They continued to argue with me and passing the buck on responsibility for denying me the service I paid for.  These types of interactions are akin to theft.   I left the reception desk stunned at the experience in was being subjected to. We were forced to use the room as we couldn't cancel day of.  We were then sent out to find our room with a stroller, 2 small kids, a hungry disappointed wife, and no directions to find our room.  The area is quite large and we had to come back and ask for help to find our room and then return to the desk yet again, because our keys didn't work.    We eventually got into our room to find that they are quite old standard mexi style with spackled stucco walls and ceilings (which had been painted many times presumably to cover up the mold that inevitably makes it though on that style in humid situations) uneven tiles and loud rattling old fans. The room was cleanish ....but dated.  The toilet in the bathroom was leaking across the floor. There is an upcharge for everything including WiFi even though that also said it was included on the site when we booked along with the food.  We tried to order Uber eats but the hotel is gated from recieving deliveries.  We left promptly to eat elsewhere as we refused to give anymore money to a dishonest establishment.    On our previous stay in Cabo we went to the Sunrock hotel in cabo where the Rooms were nicer and 1/3 of the price and the customer service was infinitly better.   In fact we extended our stay there.   Solmar should be embarrassed and ashamed. Zero accountability gets you zero star reviews..... and they certainly earned this one. We made a huge mistake staying here. It was not worth the stress of arguing with Hotel managers who literally don't understand the first thing about customer service.  I noticed that NOW on Agoda they have updated the site to have both all inclusive and room only options but this was not the case for me a month ago when I booked.  All I got was 2 managers telling me it was anyone else's fault but theirs and demanding more money to get what I paid for.  What a joke .  Never returning.…","Responded Apr 25, 2022","Response from Luis A, General Manager at Solmar ResortResponded Apr 25, 2022","Dear Mr. Campbell from Nelson, Canada:  Our commitment is to provide the best possible service to our guests, I apologize if this has not been the case.

1072,LOVE Solmar!,5,4,2022,Ann A,"This was our second stay at Solmar.  We will return next year to be sure.  What we like best:  the relative smaller size and quiet atmosphere as compared to some of the other resorts in the area.  When we vacation, we want the option to unwind and relax.  The location of the Solmar on the Pacific Ocean provides daily sightings of Grey Whales FROM THE ROOM!  The beach, although not swimmable, is breathtaking and spiritual in the ferocity of the waves against the beach and the rock. It was never over crowded, and always accessible. Our room - we were on the 3rd floor, with an elevator available.  The room had a well stocked kitchen (not used much since we did an all-inclusive package) with a sitting room and separate bedroom - and 2 bathrooms!  It was fun to soak in the HUGE tub after a day at the beach, touring town, or sitting by the pool. This was our first time at Solmar purchasing the all inclusive option.  Although it did not provide the somewhat overwhelming amount of options available at some of the ""chain"" resorts, there were plenty of options, even for those like myself with food allergy challenges.  The quality and preparation of the food was top notch as well, and Mexican Fiesta night was a kick. Guielle (hoping I got the spelling correct) who took care of our room was amazing. Great timing, and kept things super tidy for us. Gabriela was wonderful to help with any question before we arrived.  Abraham at the front desk was cheerful and helpful with each question. Noe Cabera - most amazing Concierge EVER.  From the time we arrived and asked to upgrade, to the last minute of me stupidly needing the room safe unlocked Noe provided fast, cheerful and incredible service.

1089,"No refund, no receipt ",1,2,2019,PeaceFrog0521,"I stayed here once in April 2018 form my first trip for my company. Older but well decorated lobby. The rooms are far from it though, old, outdated, poorly lit, and a long walk away. The room was unnecessarily large, but with no amenities. My company doesn’t let us drive ourselves in Mexico, and this hotel is away from the main road so I couldn’t go for snacks or drinks. Restaurant is nice but overpriced; $15 USD for breakfast.   I had to book there again in November as other hotels were already booked, but then had to cancel due to unavoidable changes in plans. I canceled almost a week prior to my check in. They would not negotiate for a refund or even a future stay credit. They get enough business that they could have covered it. My colleague and I were each charged 2 days stay, and never received a receipt.

1090,"Judgmental, rude & unprofessional receptionists. Don’t bother!",1,2,2019,Titamn,"Wedding gift ruined.   We pre-arrange a special package (Wedding night) for a very special “just married couple”.   Unfortunately, front desk was certainly not professional and neither organized. They behave with such arrogant attitude towards some customers that it is hard to believe it. Do they realize “apartheid” should be forbidden?  Saltillo has “charming” areas but it’s not Monaco or Dubai. Please!   Moreover, golden rule: customers should be treated respectfully. No need to make paying customers uncomfortable or unwelcome due to biased staff who’s also not in control.   Therefore, we strongly recommend to management to train their staff properly. This is a serious and delicate matter. They’re a service provider focused on customer’s satisfaction making use of a well known hotel chain that we’re sure that it’s not pro discrimination on local customers.   Some of the staff behave as the typical and judgmental “door man” at a club. Unbelievable!  The prices are too high considering the poor service received. We have stayed in all types of hotels around the world and even some hostels have better front desk service than this hotel.  The issues are listed below:  1. Pre-arrangement was not fully respected. Further clarifications were needed.   2. Important details were omitted at the moment of the pre-arrangement. We had to talk with the employees more than once on phone and in person on already discussed issues. They made us go personally more than once to the premises to arrange this “forgotten issues” otherwise they’d not let in the newlyweds into their already paid suite. Please inform appropriately the customers.   3. A professional and experienced staff can foresee any common issues or share best practices in order to provide a quality service in such special occasion or even on daily business. They have failed terribly on this area.   4. Newlyweds (guests) were made felt uncomfortable since the moment they arrived. Unfortunately, they were not treated properly due to the fact that some of the team members (receptionists) feel entitled to be judgmental or discriminative by the way of talking or looking at them. Attitude! Moreover, the access to their already pre-paid suite was denied. Unlawful.  5. When the staff at front desk was confronted with our complaint, “ridiculous excuses” were given. Never showed the intention to compensate or to quickly fix it. Useless and inexistent help combined with arrogance. Deadly combination on the hospitality sector.   Therefore, we are extremely disappointed that the surprise was not only ruined but the time of our guests and our time was not respected by the arrogant, unprofessional and unapologetic front desk staff of this hotel.   Even if the rest of the hotel staff did their best, above mentioned experience took so much energy and it was so time consuming for everyone. Moreover, left bad memories on us and specially on newlyweds. Sad.   We don’t recommend this hotel at all. No ownership on issues presented was shown.   To be avoided unless you pass the bias “test” by receptionists or you’re a Sheikh/Shaykhah.…","Responded Feb 12, 2019","Response from Andres V, Director General at Quinta Real SaltilloResponded Feb 12, 2019","Good Afternoon,  Thank you for your feedback.

The front desk staff helped link us with drivers to the airport. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet.  It changes slightly every morning, but always had made to order omlets/scrambles with fresh vegetables, a waffle station, loads of fresh fruit, pastries, sweets such as rice pudding, 3 fresh juices, pancakes, tostadas, bean dishes, and meat dishes.  We thought $10 was a very reasonable price.

The most frustrating thing was when we arrived, we shortly realized that we needed to stay in Saltillo another day.  My wife asked the front desk if we could extend our stay for another day, and at the same rate.  She told me it was done.  When we checked out, the rate had tripled for the third night, and no one seemed to remember my wife extending the reservations.  I had also booked through Fiesta Rewards which had a special for 25% discount on food and beverages which I opted for, and was listed in the reservation.  The hotel did not give me the discount, and did not seem to know anything about the discount with my reservation.  All in all, the hotel cost me about USD$200 more than it should have.…","Responded May 7, 2018","Response from 439JuanL, Gerente at Fiesta Inn SaltilloResponded May 7, 2018","Dear Mr.  I appreciate the time to send your comments, which are very important for us, beforehand I reiterate my commitment in service   Best regards  Juan López General Manager "

Rooms are small but comfy and new. Front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. Location is good as it has access to nearby HEB, universities, malls, etc. We brought our two small dogs, which is a plus given it seems to be the only hotel in Torreon accepting pets. We saw many other pet owners around.  The only negative to me is the hefty MX$300 fee per pet / night once has to pay. It really has no other benefit that bringing the dog (no special cleaning, service, etc) for this fee.

1141,"Great Hotel, good location! Good value!",5,10,2013,Rafitravels,"Married, 33 years Stayed there with my wife.      I stayed there last summer for 2 nights with my wife to visit some friends and relatives. The hotel location is great is near of the major shopping center and good restaurants, actually there are on walking distance so that is very convenient.      Staff at the check in was fluent in English even that we could speak Spanish they spoke English perfectly, that´s good when you are traveling in Mexico specially on a city that the major of the hotels are for business and not for tourism, check-in process was fast and without any problems, got our room key in less than 5 minutes, also there were people helping us with our luggage at all times even we were traveling kind of light.      I used the Wi-Fi service and it worked well, even I was connected from my room so I didn´t leave my room , good signal from there, also I saw that they have some PC´s on the lobby in case that you don’t bring your laptop or tablet, in addition we liked that they have a pool specially during summer in Torreon where you can get 110°F so a pool is always a plus.      One of the best thing that we liked was the breakfast, was not just continental breakfast also it was hot breakfast with eggs, ham, omelets, and much more and the best part is that we got it without paying an extra cent for that, in other hotels that is not included. The service on the breakfast buffet was excellent they served at our table so fast and always with a smile on their faces.      I used the gym once and it has the basic stuff, I used for like an hour and it was good, simple and basic, I think for a 2 night visit or a weekend is more than what you need.  That weekend was a big event for some big company and they were using one of the ballrooms and its was great that they were in the other side of the rooms so we didn´t have any noise during the event and also they use the parking at the front of the hotel and not using the guest parking on the rear side of the hotel, we liked that It was kind of secure for us (the guest).     Our room was clean, odorless and good size, bed was comfortable and without any complains, when we needed to call the front desk they always answered fast and they gave us instructions for near locations also they have a shuttle van in case that you need a transportation to the airport, we didn´t know about that so we came on a taxi and on our way back to the airport we used and we saved some money there.     I truly recommend this hotel, I asked to the staff and they are family owned probably that´s why they have a very good service and they take care of their guests, sometimes the big hotel chains don’t care about people, they just care about brand name, price or rewards points.      On my next trip to Torreon definitely I would stay there again.…","Responded Dec 2, 2013","Response from HotelFresnoGaleriaH, Gerente at Hotel Fresno GaleriasResponded Dec 2, 2013","Dear Rafitravels,  Thank you very much for your good comments and I am pleased that you felt very comfortable in our instalations and with our staff who enjoy providing good personal service.

Receive a few suspicious looks from lobby staff each time I passed by and don't know why. Security, I guess.

Both the hotel and our room were very clean - the bed was extremely comfortable. The air-conditioner worked well and the shower was nice and hot too. We were expecting it to be loud due to the hotel's location which is in a central location, but our room was very quiet. The restaurant was also very good as well.

1149,Perfect Hotel to stay in Saltillo,4,6,2019,LolaKristiani,"Quinta Dorada is a very good hotel to stay in Saltillo. The room is very big and a very comfortable bed. The garden and the swimming pool also very good. Food for breakfast are ok, and the happy hour at 18.00H, we got a snack and beverages. The hotel restaurant “Pour La France” is so good!!! All food are great, and the restaurant is beautiful perfect for all occasions from romantic dinner till hangout with friends.   Ok now I have to share the “not so good” stuff too. First, the wifi is sooooo terrible, gotta login and re-login hundreds times a day, every time I locked my phone and unlocked it, I had to re-login the wifi and at least I need to do it twice in order to get the connection. Second, the breakfast served mostly with pork, hard for a Muslim like me. But the waiter today, he was nice, he made a new scrambled eggs for me without pork. Third, the Hotel staff and the restaurant staff are amazingly friendly and nice but lacking of English skill, so for a non Spanish tourist like me it’s hard to get the information I needed, but the staff did tried their best to assist me, and it’s greatly appreciated!!! Last but I think it’s not less important, the hotel is located beside the busy highway, so even though there are lots of restaurants around the hotel, to go out and crossing the street it’s a very dangerous game to play, since there are no crossing facilities like bridge, zebra cross, or even traffic light. I just saw a dog hits  by a car last night, in front of my eyes when I had dinner at Pour La France, suddenly no more appetite. I know it’s nothing to do with the hotel, but maybe the hotel can suggest an authority in Saltillo, a safer way to accommodate the guest to cross the street, maybe building a bridge, or traffic light or considering slower speed limit.   Thank you and keep improving... Cheers!!!…","Responded Jun 11, 2019","Response from quintadorada, Gerente at Quinta Dorada Hotel & SuitesResponded Jun 11, 2019","We appreciate the time you have spent to share the comments of your last stay at our hotel, they are certainly very rewarding for us.

1153,"Motel style accomodation, good quality",4,12,2018,m0livetti,"I spent two nights in this hotel, where I had already been previously (the university who kindly invites me in Saltillo always books me a room here). Rooms are large and comfortable and clean, price is reasonable. Rooms include a fridge. Breakfast may not be compared with the one you can find in large mexican hotels but is ok.  Disadvantages for a European visitor: the hotel is in the middle of a Us style commerciale area, but is far from the city center and is unsuitable for walking. Sometimes rooms on the external side of the hotel are noisy, because of the Periferico Echeverria. Another drawback of the rooms is that they only have a window looking on the balcon where people pass. So you have ti choose between external light and privacy. A good thing is the garden with the swimming pool, specially in Summer. There is a sort of French restaurant close to the hotel (not bad, after all, but very ""unmexican""...), a Starbucks and a Oxxo on the other side. Internet in the rooms not excellent but acceptable…","Responded Jan 2, 2019","Response from Gerardo L, Gerente at Quinta Dorada Hotel & SuitesResponded Jan 2, 2019","Our team would like to express our sincere thanks for the time you have spent sharing your experience during your last stay with us.

The room was pretty clean the beds where comfortable and clean however I was not very impressed with the bathroom there was mold on the tile, a few hairs here and there, and the shower did not drain well.

1161,One major issue.,2,9,2015,Lfamily83,"There was one major issue but I will start with the good. The breakfast was actually pretty good. A good size selection on things to eat and I was actually suprised that the majority of the food was Mexican. The times for check in and check out were very ideal for us. Check in at 2 and check out at 1. The rooms we stayed at were nice. A good size and with all the amenities that one would expect from a Holiday Inn. The beds were very comfortable. This is a Holiday Inn Express and what became very obvious was the express way this hotel was constructed. This isn't a major gripe but it was pretty obvious that there were corners cut or just bad construction. Both the lock and the hinges on our door looked like they would easily come off. The tile in the bathroom was also uneven. Of course to me this is mainly a presentation blemish more than anything else. I care more about things like; a/c, cold/hot water, etc. The main issue was the price of the stay. We inquired about our stay a full two weeks prior to our stay. I ended up calling their 1-800 number cause I couldn't figure out their rates. In retrospect that should have been the first red flag. I was told on the phone that the stay for two double rooms would be $178 per night. You can have up to 4 adults per room but the regular rate for the room is considering only 2 per room.  There is a extra charge for another adult in the room (I was told on the phone that would be a additional $15 but in person it was $17). That is very confusing considering they advertise the double occupancy room for 4 adults! Lastly I asked the agent if there were any additional charges I might expect on my check out. Like taxes. She said that they were already included. That the only thing that might change a little is the currency exchange. Once we arrived we were helped by the receptionist Ernesto. He informed us the stay would cost us $285! We asked why the change in price? He stated that the room rate was $110 per room. And a additional 16% tax and 3% hospitality rate. I'm not sure how they do math at this hotel. Even at a 20% tax and hospitality rate. At $220 rate for both rooms I still don't came out with $285. Not to mention the exchange at the hotel was 14 pesos for the dollar. When everywhere else it was at least 16. Considering how exchange houses were averaging 16.5 pesos to the dollar at that day. We were about to cancel our reservation when Ernesto suggested that he can come up with a better rate if we just book the rooms as if we just showed up. Which makes absolutely no sense. But by then we just needed the rooms. We paid $210 for the rooms. The main reason for such a low rating has to be the suspicious at best type of business they conduct at this Holiday Inn. Not to mention Ernesto all of a sudden growing some sort of Argentine accent during our conversation. Sorry for the long review,,,,but hopefully others will be informed.…","Responded Sep 15, 2015","Response from ElsaAcosta, Manager at Holiday Inn Express Piedras Negras, an IHG HotelResponded Sep 15, 2015","We verify what happened about the cost of the room , the reserve rate they had 5 guests per room  that made the cost of the rate will rise and  confirming information arrival rate was very surprising, to  remedy that detail the receptionist offered an appropriate option giving  them the day rate was lower and without charging extra adults , we hope  that this plea does not prevent stay with us appreciate your comments  also because they are of great value to improve and give good service"

The rooms are small and our bedding wasn't exactly picture perfect.  The mattress is hard so be prepared.  However the rooms are pretty clean...i think they could use a vacuum but other then that no complaints.  The bathrooms are clean and good size so you are not turning in circles to take a shower and the water temp was good and hot.   Ice machines on the 1st, 3rd and 5th floors.

Still unchanged, perfectly located in the heart of town, keeping its charm. It is true, it does not have AC units...because Saltillos' altitud above the sea level (1500 m or about 4500 feet) provides the city with wonderful weather during this time of year.","Responded Nov 6, 2017","Response from GeneralManagerslw, Gerente at Urdinola HotelResponded Nov 6, 2017","Hi Manuel M Thank you for taking the time and express your opinion of our property, we take pride in the history of our Hotel Urdinola, we are glad you had a great moment.

1188,Reminds me of a hostel,4,4,2017,CLHop,"Urdinola Hotel offered the perfect location for our stay in Saltillo. It was convenient to walk to both historic areas and shopping and I felt safe even when on my own. The hotel is charming and the staff is friendly and helpful. It was lovely to wake to the sound of birds in the courtyard. The property is beautiful in design, though it is a little rough around the edges. The sheets and towels were well worn, the grounds and rooms were not as clean as they could be, the wifi didn't reach our room and sometimes didn't work in the lobby, and the plumbing is rustic. It felt more more of a good hostel than a hotel. In spite of all of this, I am so happy we chose to stay at Urdinola Hotel and I definitely recommend it, just know that it is not as polished and perfected as a mainstream hotel.…","Responded Jun 25, 2017","Response from GeneralManagerslw, General Manager at Urdinola HotelResponded Jun 25, 2017","Thank you for taking the time to answer the online survey about your recent stay at our hotel.

1189,Beautiful colonial hotel centrally located no A/C,4,7,2016,mtlbaltdan,"The hotel is a real beauty with its Spanish colonial arches and storied past.  It's terrifically centrally located for exploring the Centro of Saltillo, being within a minute of the cathedral and the music emanating from the plazas and Calle Padre Flores.  My only reason for not giving it a higher mark is the lack of A/C, which made sleeping at night a bit uncomfortable.

1190,Beware: Extortion attempted inside the hotel.,1,4,2021,Carlos G,"This is the first time I have stayed in this location.   I checked in Tuesday. Thursday night (around 10 p.m.) the phone in the room rang. When I picked up, it was the front desk to inform me I got a call. I take it, and the person in the other end says my full name, my room number (and even the number of another on which I stayed the first day), the name of the company I worked for, and informs me he is the manager of the Real Inn and that there has been an issue: There is car in the hotel's parking lot that has been reported as stolen, therefore the police is in the hotel, working things out, so they are going around, knocking on every door to find out if the thief is there. He asked me to stay inside, door locked. If anyone knocks on my door I should not open.   Then he said that he will turn the phone to the commander in chief so he could give me more details... Since I have heard about this extorsion before, I hanged up the phone immediately.   I called the front desk and asked them if their manager just called me. The guy in front desk tells me that this is not the case, the call came from Monterrey and that he passed it to me just because the guy calling told him my name. I told him to don't pass any other call to my room as long as I remain in the hotel.     I am pretty sure they got all my info from the what I provided when I checked in.

1195,Sleepless night,2,6,2017,west5er,"The whole point of a hotel for me is being able to relax and get rest, so this review is to help those people out there who, like me, cannot sleep in a HOT room. The problem is the air conditioning system is operated with a motion sensor. Which means when you go to bed at night in a comfortable temperature and there is no longer movement in the room to keep the A/C activated, the room then becomes unbelievably hot and stuffy. It woke me at 2am and was 80 degrees in the room. I could not get back to sleep for the entire night. At around 6am, when I had to rouse myself out of my heat coma and started walking around, the A/C started again-thanks. This is our crew layover hotel and we have no choice but to stay here for the duration of the contract. We stay in hotels for a living and I have only encountered this cruel system thankfully only a handful of times. I can't believe a hotel would install such a system in a place that gets so hot. Why would you do this to your guests? So other than the brutally hot room, the hotel is fine. There are lots of places to eat and shops etc. The pool looks nice-we weren't there long enough to use it on that layover. I had a view of the pool from my room and when we checked in late that night I saw plenty of used towels strewn all around that were still there the next morning. I also had no coffee maker in my room. And this is odd, no wash cloths or hand towels, only two bath towels. I called for some hand towels and someone came with two more bath towels. The best part of the stay is the breakfast, it's very good. There's an omelet bar and nice fruit and excellent service by friendly staff. But I'd trade it for a cool room and restful night for sure.…","Responded Aug 22, 2017","Response from Ricardo M, Director General at Real Inn TorreónResponded Aug 22, 2017","Dear guest,  I apologize for not responding on time and for the terrible experience during your stay, I am the new manager of the Hotel.

1201,Don't risk your safety! Our was compromised,1,11,2018,Margarita C,"There were 2 key issues that occurred during my stay at this hotel:1. Lady at front desk, do not remember her name, she has black straight hair, was rude and dismissive. We found ourselves constantly having to go back to the front desk to get our keys activated. The 3rd time I was asking her what was the problem with the keys and she mumbled ""keys are too sensitive"" and proceeded to apparently do something on very computer while I was still standing there, I was explaining to her where I kept the key, as I though it would of interest to know that perhaps the keys used were defective and not too sensitive as implied. yet she kept typing and after finally noticing I was still standing there she lifted her head up and said ""the keys are sensitive what else do you want me to tell you""? She never apologized and rolled her eyes. I just walked away. Without fail everytime everyday we had to stop by front desk and get our keys activated.2nd issue and most critical, was our safety was put in danger. We received several calls to our rooms, and then our US cell phones, one was made to asking to confirm if we were in room XXX, giving us the room number we were in, saying they were going to come in and check due to security concerns and red alert. How did they get our US cell numbers?? How did they get our full names? Another attempt was made calling the hotel, front desk would call me and ask if I was expecting a call, I told them no, and the guy's comment was "" ha ha yeah sometimes people call to bother our clients"" Really?? this was laughing matter? and they call our US cell phones to just bother us? The hotel was so insecure that we left before midnight and no one noticed the person that picked us up told he could've easily just gone up to our floors nobody would've questioned him. This was an attempt of extortion possibly kidnapping for ransom, my questions was how di they get our personal information? If it wasn't provided by hotel, no one else knew our rooms, our US cell numbers. Trust that I will NEVER stay at this hotel again, the worst experience in my life! Almost forgot when I asked about shuttle to airport they informed me that it started at 6am, for me ni problem its typical, however the guy at front desk said "" we do offer extra services for our customers, and we can see if my ""comparer"" wants to come in earlier and can maybe take you to airport, but you have to pay in cash"" my question to him if this hotel provided extra service why cant it be bill…","Responded Jan 9, 2019","Response from Angelica M, Director de Relaciones Públicas at Hampton Inn by Hilton Torreón-Airport GaleríasResponded Jan 9, 2019","Thank you very much for your comments, regarding your most recent stay with us.

1204,My Preferred Hotel,4,7,2018,Dean H,"Right off the bat, the key card opened our door, there was water in the room and the restaurant served food, which makes it better than the Saltillo hotel we stayed in last month. I was concerned about the hotel based on other reviews, but we were very satisfied.  The room had new laminate floors (not old carpeting) and the furniture was in good shape.  The bathroom is retro, but clean and functional.   Overall, we had a great night's sleep and were happy with dinner and breakfast.  I think this is our new preferred hotel in Saltillo.","Responded Jul 23, 2018","Response from GeneralManagerslw, Gerente at Quality Inn & Suites Saltillo EurotelResponded Jul 23, 2018","Dear Dean H Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the Quality Inn & Suites Saltillo.

1209,Rude service from receptionist!,1,6,2014,Titamn,"We were regulars in this hotel. But not anymore!   Pros:  -awesome bed. Extremely comfy. -good service from staff in the breakfast area.  -better rooms from left wing of you have the main entrance behind you.   Cons: -too pricey for quality -old rooms -old decorations -not super clean -sometimes you'd get good amenities. Other days just wouldn't get complete service.  -wifi doesn't work everywhere in the hotel. Or simply wouldn't work.  -WC would get stuck!  -continental breakfast is too simple. If you want more you have to pay. -reception people used to be nice and let us get a late check out from time to time. This would accommodate perfectly in our traveling schedule. However, the last time because of the change of management, they said ""It wasn't possible"". This is not annoying since these are the rules. We understand. However, The RUDE attitude was annoying! The receptionist called and said in a rude and annoying attitude ""Bring the key to reception personally, asap"".  When in this hotel leaving the key at the room and calling that you were leaving was enough. The key it was brought and explained that we were regulars and this attitude was not accepted. So we would never come back. They didn't apologize at all. Disappointing!   The only reason to stay here for is was the bed and the friendly staff. After our experience we wouldn't stay here anymore.

1234,"Be prepared with extra cash to cover ""inconveniences""",1,4,2017,Miguel X,"I booked the room a month in advance, through a travel agency, the total fee was settled for two nights of lodging, however upon entering I was asked for a credit card to cover any incident or to pay a cash deposit of $ 3,000 MX pesos (around of $160 USD), I told the Manager Martha that I did not have that cash at the moment but this could fee could be charged to my debit card... She said NO, no debit card is allowed, she offered me to  to take a transfer from the hotel to the nearest ATM, this treat made me feel uncomfortable, because it seemed a kind of extortion ... The hotel staff would take me to the ATM... I would get the money from the ATM and the hotel staff would take me back to the hotel with $ 3000 pesos in cash, otherwise She will not be authorized to continue the check in process! ... She said... I am sorry but you are not allowed to check in, no matters if the two nights hotel fee was paid ... the option was: credit card or cash ... debit card is not accepted.   I said - OK, if you are not going to do charges to my credit card, then, try to iron or mark my credit card... she tried to pass the credit card and open a voucher for ""incidents"" ... my card did not supported  that credit, this was bank rejected for a few pesos ... she said ... sorry I can't allow you to check in, even though you have already paid for both nights.   I told her that I would call the travel agency to cancel the booking, but any cancellation would cost me a penalty of one night... at end the travel agency helped me and open a voucher on behalf of me... of course ... now I should be grateful with her because the manager do some exceptions in my case... I was just interested on a nap, I was not prepared to deal with additonal hotel policies. $3000 pesos is too much, other hotels at the same category ask for $1000 pesos...  During the check in I asked to accumulate my NH rewards  points to my account... the receptionist answered that this is not possible because the reservation had been made via ""hotels.com"" which was not true.   I advise you looking for other hotels at the area. This hotel is nice but does not have human warmth ...

Although the thermostat has settings for heating and cooling, only one will actually work.  The system will either blow cold air or hot air.  If you are like me, and you need a cold room to sleep well, it is necessary to call and have engineering to switch your room from hot air to cold air during the winter months.

Only complaints are the lack of a store for buying snacks and drinks, and the inability to accomodate connecting room requests ahead of time. Other than that, the front desk staff, housekeeping, and restaurant servers were great. They also let us keep our car in their parking garage while we went on El Chepe for two days (we were returning to stay there following the trip).","Responded Aug 13, 2019","Response from Arturo P, Front Office Manager at Sheraton Chihuahua SoberanoResponded Aug 13, 2019","Thank you for your comments, we are very glad that you enjoyed your time with us, we hope to host your very soon."
1239,Poor customer service,2,8,2019,Jackie,The hotel claims to be 5 star service. They placed us in a room on the first floor overlooking the pool. Staff failed to inform us there was a wedding lasting until 2 a.m. at the pool. The music was blasting and the bass was pounding. I called to request a room away from the noise and was told there was nothing they could do about it. The whole point of a hotel is to have a place to get some sleep. There was no attempt to accommodate us whatsoever. I expressed my concerns the next morning and was again told there was nothing they could do about it. I’d rather stay at a motel than deal with poor service like this. I don’t recommend and my family will not be staying here next month when we come back to visit.,"Responded Aug 5, 2019","Response from Arturo P, Front Office Manager at Sheraton Chihuahua SoberanoResponded Aug 5, 2019","Thank you for choosing to stay at the Sheraton Chihuahua Soberano and providing your honest feedback.

1241,Good Hotel for One Night Stay,5,6,2019,Eduard K,"I was in Chihuahua for business. It was not pricey because od corporate rate.  PRO: 1) Breakfast buffet is excellent.  2) Magnificent and impressive views. 3) Pool area is fantastic.  CONS: 1) The air conditioner was not working but this was not the big issue. The big issue was Mold in the corner of the shower. No only one spot. Many spots of mold. But maybe easy to explain, the room isself looked a bit aged.  All in All this was an excellent experience but as i said prevoius mold in the shower is absolutely a no-go.  The staff is friendly. If i would stay again at this hotel, yes indeed.

I stayed at the Central Hotel Boutique in early October 2019 and was very glad that I did - an AMAZING boutique hotel - very comfortable room; beautifully decorated; yet what sets this hotel apart from all others is the staff.

1256,Really nice hotel ,5,9,2019,Bonnie B,"We love this place! It’s luxury in the heart of downtown chihuahua! I never thought I would see such a nice hotel here. The dining room was packed on Saturday night. It’s well worth dining here even if you’re not staying here. We stayed here for 2 nights after a big trip in Copper Canyon. I wanted tranquil luxury after all that adventure, and this beat all expectations. The staff is sophisticated and quick. The HOT TUB is great after a day of touring the Caves, Pancho Villas house and the quintagameros mansion! The hot tub is big enough for 4 - 5 people. There’s lounge music. The staff will find you anywhere in the hotel and make sure you’re being taken care of without lifting a finger, including at the hot tub. The rooms are clean, modern, luxurious and sophisticated. The beds are SO soft. The comforters are thick and fluffy. The linens are a very fine quality. The towels are incredibly fluffy. The showers have a very tall rain shower and are all marble. The lighting is impeccable. They paid attention to every little corner of this hotel. Didn’t miss a thing. I’m excited to come back here next time I take some more people through Copper Canyon and end up in Chihuahua! What a way to end an adventurous trip!…","Responded Sep 9, 2019","Response from Marcela M, Gerente at Central Hotel BoutiqueResponded Sep 9, 2019","Dear Ms Bonnie:  It was a pleasure hosting you during your staying in our city, we are so glad to know that you had enjoyed your staying with us, and we are hoping to recieve you again in a near future, for us the most important is to give you an experience of excellence in service.

1257,Luxury Tranquility and a Hot Tub!,5,9,2019,Randal D,"I booked this hotel based off a couple photos, hoping it would be nice and that it really existed. To sum it up...WOW!!!! It’s about a year old as of Sept 2019. I think it’s about a 4.5 - 5 star boutique hotel. 11 classy comfy modern rooms. Huge marble bathrooms. Impeccable bedding. Mood lighting. The staff is the same as to what you would experience at a St. Regis or Ritz Carlton. The overall hotel reminds me of the Marriott Autograph Collection Boutique hotels I stayed at in Europe. If you’re not familiar, google it. It’s high end and for a more discerning traveler. The food is AMAZING. I’d give it 5 stars! The fine dining breakfast is included in the stay, which blows my mind. It’s so good I’d pay extra for it. It’s next to the big church so location is perfect. Its not on the street. It’s on the sidewalk so there’s no traffic in front of the entrance. There’s lounge music playing throughout the courtyards, hot tub, and lounge area upstairs. Lounge Beds upstairs are super comfortable. There’s a honesty bar on the roof with Moet, beer, water, etc. There’s also fresh soft blankets and great pillows to chill out on. There’s a view of the upper part of the church. Lots of beautiful plants around the hotel. There’s an additional indoor area, aside from the bar, that’s full of lovely seating arrangements. The dining room looks like something out of the Victorian era. And yes....the hot tub is great after a long day of sightseeing! The trolley picks up people like 30 seconds away to go on the city tour. That’s nice but it was easier for us to just walk or taxi. We walked to Pancho Villas house and the other popular mansion. Worth it! Went to the caves! Even though it’s in Spanish and we don’t speak it well, it’s still incredible and fun!  Just some tips...a casual, modern open air restaurant to eat lunch with notable street tacos is around the corner. It’s called Sotolerios. And for live music I recommend 7 Leguas. Again, more modern and open air. Really popular so make reservations. Downstairs from 7 Leguas are multiple restaurants. Last night a huge professional mariachi band was playing for the restaurants. So many options. It’s safe there too!  Also the photos don’t do it justice! Only allowed to upload 10 photos. There’s so many great photos of the hotel that I don’t know which ones to choose.…","Responded Sep 9, 2019","Response from Marcela M, Gerente at Central Hotel BoutiqueResponded Sep 9, 2019","Dear Mr Randal We are so happy to know you had a great experience during your visit in Chihuahua, for us the most important is to give you wonderful experience based on the excellence in service Thank you so much for all your comments and pictures, we really hope to have the opportunity of hosting you again in a very near future.

1263,Relatively new and nice hotel but...,3,9,2019,@Pi,"We made reservations at this hotel for two nights since my Mother was having surgery at a close by hospital.  Check in was excellent and the hotel is relatively new, overall, the hotel is in very nice condition and clean.   The following morning, we had to call the front desk early morning so that maintenance would come over.  We had no hot water!  It turned out that we had to wait over 20 min with the water running so that we could get hot water.  What a waste!    We left BEFORE 7 AM for my mother’s surgery (by the way, we did not leave the “do not disturb sign on the door”) and came back to the room at about 2:00 PM (seven hours later) to find out that our room had not been cleaned!!  I was furious because my mother was still a bit dizzy from the sedation and she needed to lie down.  I called the front desk and the reply was simply that “the house keeper had until 5 PM to clean all rooms and that if I needed the room cleaned “early” I should have told the front desk the night before”.  I asked if I could get the room cleaned right away so I had to take my mother to the lobby so she could rest while the room was cleaned.  On our way out, we met the housekeeping supervisor and she said that “the housekeeper had so many rooms to clean” that is why our room was not ready.  By the way, neither the front desk staff nor the housekeeping supervisor apologized for our inconvenience.    We went down to the lobby area and asked the front desk lady if I could speak to the manager.  She told me that the manager was out for lunch so I asked if I could speak to someone else.  There was a Sales manager, Eduardo Barajas, who overhead my request and he asked me what the problem was.  He listened to me with patience, apologized and promised to try and fix the problem.    In the meantime my mother and I waited at the lobby and the front desk lady offered to give us a suite so we could go there right away instead of waiting for our room to be ready.  The lady was honestly worried and offered an apology which I appreciated.    In summary, we had a bad experience but both Eduardo, the Sales manager, and the front desk lady tried their best to compensate for the inconvenience.    I am still giving a three start to this hotel because the staff needs to be trained to give better answers to an unhappy customer instead of trying to make excuses for the bad and unorganized service. Eduardo assured me that they already discussed the situation as a team and they will try to avoid this from happening again. …","Responded Sep 23, 2019","Response from Edmee G, Gerente at Courtyard by Marriott ChihuahuaResponded Sep 23, 2019","I apologize for the inconvenience you suffered during your stay at the hotel, I am very sorry to read that my staff did not have the empathy for the situation you were experiencing at the time, I appreciate that you took the time to let me know what happened As Eduardo indicated, we take the necessary actions so that similar situations do not happen again.

1272,Comfortable Stay After a Long Road Trip,4,3,2018,jeffhollymx,"We were driving from Zacatecas, Mexico to the Border, and decided Chihuahua would have the greatest selection of Hotels to spend the night.  We arrived without a reservation and were given a first floor room at a reasonable rate.  The Hotel is located on the Pereferico, the Hwy which circles the city of Chihuahua.  It is a newer hotel, very well maintained , with a complimentary Happy Hour offered at 7:00 pm and also a tasty breakfast buffet.  There is a Chili's right next door, which was perfect for my husband to watch a March Madness Game.  We only stayed one night, so did not take advantage of any of its other offerings.  We enjoyed our stay and would return, if in the area.","Responded Sep 15, 2018","Response from Edmee G, Gerente at Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham ChihuahuaResponded Sep 15, 2018","Dear guest, thank you very much for your comments, the objective of all of us who work in the hotel is to achieve the full satisfaction of our guests, the feedback that makes us please to share allows us to work on our failures and try to be better, receive a best regads from all the hotel staff."

Hotel is also a short drive from downtown, ~15min depending on traffic. We had a room with double beds and it was very spacious; our friends got a room with a queen bed and felt kind rather small. We stayed here on a weekend and it was busy, specially during breakfast which was included but which I did not try personally. Bed was comfortable and clean. Hotel feels a little outdated but certainly not a big deal if you don't mind that.","Responded Sep 15, 2018","Response from Edmee G, Gerente at Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham ChihuahuaResponded Sep 15, 2018","Dear guest, thank you very much for your comments, the objective of all of us who work in the hotel is to achieve the full satisfaction of our guests, the feedback that makes us please to share allows us to work on our failures and try to be better, receive a best regads from all the hotel staff."
1275,Customer service needs improvement ASAP,3,11,2017,ringmav,"This is a good hotel to get if you’re on a business trip or just passing by for a couple of days. If you’re staying more than 3 nights, i’d probably suggest staying elsewhere. Dont get me wrong, the room is really cozy. It has a window seat/bed which is a little hard for my taste but nothing a couple of pillows can’t fix. Enough space in between beds with mirrors behind them, a desk and a small closet. No mini fridge or anything else.Standard usual bathroom. While most hotels in Mexico have mini split a/c units, this one has the big old type, and the knob wasn’t working properly. But what i liked about the room is that there’s no light coming in when you close the curtains. The beds are comfy and so are the pillows, so you will get a good nights sleep no problem.They have breakfast included but its nothing special. They also have a mini gym; again, nothing to brag about. Outside they a couple of vending machines if you want a snack or a soda. Now, their customer service leaves a lot to be desired. Of the 3 lobby clerks i ran into, only one greeted us when we came in. We arrived a bit early and check in wasnt until 3, so they had us wait in the lobby until they could “verify for empty rooms”. So it wasnt until 3 hrs later, around 2pm, when we were falling aslepp in the lobby, that we were finally given a room. I called and asked if they had either a toothbrush or toothpaste, they didnt have either. They didnt even have small wash cloths, which was hard to believe. So even though the clerks were never rude, they werent going out of their way to make a good impression. But the night security woman WAS rude. We were outside in the back parking lot and she shut and locked the door. And we were in the lobby, and if you raised your voice slightly, she wouldnt say something or ask you to lower your voice, she would flat out yell at you to shut up.Even though this didnt happen to me, i was there in the lobby when it happened and thought that politely asking to lower the decibels would’ve done the trick, but i guess she wanted to feel important. The room key cards were a real hassle. They would work 1 out of 5 tries, or sometimes not at all. Ice dispensing machine on the third floor never had any ice. Ok now unto other rando stuff: They have a shuttle service which will take you places nearby. Speaking of, this is a great selling point because it has several restaurants and good places nearby: in the same parking lot of the hotel, you’ll find both, a Chili’s and Wendy’s. Follow the same street and there’s a Mcdonalds and a wing joint. On the other side of the avenue there’s a Ricky’s Tacos, a Carls Jr and a supermarket, and finally, across those places is the Fashion Mall, the newest and largest mall in Chihuahua city. The mall has several good stores and of course the obligatory food court with a couple of good places to eat. A Cinepolis movie theater is also inside the mall. It might be the biggest mall but again, its nothing special. Not bad but not good either. IMO, if youre on a budget (i got it for $45 a night) and just passing by or on a business trip, then i would recommend this hotel for sure... but im willing to bet there are far better hotels in the city.…","Responded Sep 15, 2018","Response from Edmee G, Gerente at Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham ChihuahuaResponded Sep 15, 2018","Dear guest, thank you very much for your comments, the objective of all of us who work in the hotel is to achieve the full satisfaction of our guests, the feedback that makes us please to share allows us to work on our failures and try to be better, receive a best regads from all the hotel staff."

But here, it seemed the walls were paper thin.  I was able to hear everything pretty much from the hallway, and the adjacent rooms.  Adding to this, I made my reservation online, adding the payment info to what I considered pre-paid.  How ever, when I got there, the payment was not registered, so I had to get a different card (my personal), to pay for it.   The man at the front desk was not very helpful for it.    But, I have to say, the beds are really comfy!  And so are the pillows.  The cleaning staff was really friendly.  A lot of safe parking space, great location: good restaurants close by and a mall worth visiting.","Responded Apr 26, 2016","Response from Edmee G, General Manager at Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham ChihuahuaResponded Apr 26, 2016","Dear Guest thank you very much for taking the time to let us feedback on your stay at the hotel, I offer an apology for the details that had particularly about the little communication with your payment, for us is very important the feedback we receive from our guests as it allows us to detect areas of opportunity and work on them.

1287,Best Western Mirador with Vivabus hints,4,8,2015,submarinernm,"The rooms at the Best Western Mirador are very large and great for Families traveling in town or launching a trip to Creel and the Copper Canyon. I really like that the Hotel is located right on Universidad Avenue with ease access to a Vivabus Station. There are also two rent-a-car dealers right next to the hotel if you did not bring your car.  The hotel looks and feels just like the Best Westerns of the roadway from west Texas, New Mexico and Arizona in the USA. The large rooms open onto a central parking lot where you park just outside the room. The hotel has two stories, so we had a room on the second floor near the end. The kids loved the indoor hotel and their was lots of room to just sit down and relax.   The Hotel has a good restaurant and bar on property, which makes it great for staying on site.   Getting around:   A one way taxis run to downtown is about 3 dollars. Walking to downtown is about 3/4 of a mile and takes about 15 to 20 minutes. I uploaded a taxis rate sheet for the City from the hotel for your review.  While we were there, we took the local public transportation called 'Vivabus' from the Deza y Ulloa Station on Universidad Ave, just a block from the hotel. The cost is a onetime charge of 20 pesos for your bus card and 6 pesos or about 40 cents per person for each stop, no matter the length of route. Note: Buy one card and use it for the members of your group.   To use the Vivabus, look for the Red Stations in the middle of Universidad and pick up the bus in the direction you want to go. The Buses on the North/South route are new Mercedes Marco Polo, Air Conditioned ones which are very similar to those in the big Cities in the US. The main bus route goes North to South through the City, so if you wish to go downtown, take the South route which heads to the right of the Station. To return from downtown, take the North Route back to the Hotel.  There are several station stops in the Central Historic Area which will take you extremely close to specific restaurants, Museums and Plazas. Please note that the downtown loop of Vivabus is figure 8 with certain stops only available on the South or North Routes.   Here are important stops for your stay at the Best Western Mirador:  Hotel bus stop for either direction is Deza Y Ulloa.  These are the South Route stops from hotel :  Fuentes Danzarinas is the stop for the Templo de San Francisco de Asís, Casa Chihuahua, Palace of the Governors, 14 Coffees, the Hidalgo's Dungeon, Plaza de Angel, Grand Plaza of Chihuahua and the Chihuahua Barbaro - Day tours main ticket office.  Juarez Station is the stop for the Casa Juarez or the Museum of the Republic. Casa Siglo XIX is just two blocks from the Juarez station on the Right hand side of the street. Casa Siglo XIX is a wonderful art museum downtown with wonderful free public restrooms near the Cathedral.   The Sagrado Corazon Station will take you to the steps of the Sacred Heart Cathedral. If you walk up Avenue 20 de Noviembre two blocks to Calle 10a then take a right onto Calle 10a and walk two more blocks, you be at the entrance of the Pancho Villa Museum.    These are the North Route stops from the hotel :  The Quinta Gameros Station will take you right in front of the beautiful French Styled Quinta Gameros house completed in 1910. This is a one of the most beautiful homes in all of Mexico and is a must stop for those who love architecture.  The Catedral Station is on the under pass directly below the Catedral de Chihuahua and its great plaza. Once you get off the bus, just walk up two flights of stairs and you are right next to the Cathedral. This is also the stop for the Quality Inn where the Chihuahua Barbaro tour bus departs 4 times a day. This is also a great stop to return to the hotel after your trip downtown.  The Sor Juana Station, traveling north from the hotel, will take you to an Alsuper grocery store which will provide you all your food and convenience items needs on the trip. An Alsuper is very similar to the neighborhood Wal-Mart stores open in the US. The Alsuper has a great café for a quick affordable lunch and dinner as will as good prices on beer and wine for the room. They have weekly beer special and I was able to buy German Beck's and Sam Adams Cherry Wheat beer for 6 pesos a bottle during our stay. When finished shopping, take the south bus route back to the Hotel.   VIVABUS Instructions :  To ride the bus, you will need to use the Red Ticket machines in the Station to buy and charge your bus card. If you select the American Flag on the machine's screen, the instructions will switch to English for easy use. The Bus Cards will cost a one-time charge of 20 pesos. Next place the card in the slot and recharge the card with Mexican coins or bills. Remember to press the green checkmark after you enter your money and leave the card in place until the money has been deposited to the card. There is a little white card reader on a pole at the front of most stations which will let you check your balance.

We learnt the hotel is best known for it hot breakfast buffet, which was well served. Tha hotel has a pool, which due to my travel time restriction didn't get to use but I would recommended as it's located in the middle ofa beautiful garden.

1312,Horrible experience,2,5,2018,Jocelyn R,"I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and hated it.  Let’s start with the HORRIBLE customer service at the front reception. There was an older male the night we got there and he was very rude, would look at the watch when we were taking out our cards to pay.  The room was clean, but the restroom was not flushing. We called the front desk to report it and they did send someone the next day to fix it. However, the water would get trapped on the restroom sink and on the shower. This was sooo gross! I wanted to throw up every morning.  I was going to request a different room but my friend told me that she was having the same problem in her room, so I assume this is an issue with the hotel. This hotel is super old, so that might have something to do.

1320,Hotel is dated but service is good,4,1,2017,David L,"We had a 4 night stay during the Christmas holidays.  The hotel was pretty full with lots of families travelling to see their loved ones in Mexico.    Room  We stayed in a room with 2 queen beds.  The room was clean, the beds were firm but comfortable and long enough to fit a 6'3"" man.  The furniture is dated but the walls, TV and everything else has been updated.  The room had a side door that connected to the room next door.  However, if someone is staying next door, you will be able to hear them.  That's why I recommend the rooms that are in the back of the hotel.  They assign less people there so it's quieter.  One day early in the morning however, the cleaning ladies knocked at our door to ask us if we needed any laundry washed.  After we put the ""Do not Disturb"" sign on the door, they stopped leaving coffee (our room number was 108).  Restaurant  The restaurant has a delicious breakfast buffet which I highly recommend.  They serve chilaquiles, made to order eggs, pancakes, yogurt, granola, fruit, menudo, beans, coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice, milk, etc.  Bar  I ordered a Michelada and the barman brought out all of the ingredients so that I could make it.  He also said that the bar closes at 11 pm, however, the hotel's website and the security guard told me that it closes at midnight.  My suggestion is that the barman needs to be sent to barman school to learn how to make mixed drinks.  Grounds  The grounds were clean and green.  The swimming pool is about 10 yards long and 4 yards wide which is a good size pool.  They even have security guards that only let guests park in the parking lot.  I loved having that extra piece of mind knowing that my vehicle has being watched 24/7.  Reception  Check in and check out was fast and easy.   Outstanding Employees  We appreciate the service with a smile that we received from one of the reception employees.  I don't know her name but she is middle aged, has gray hair and wears a pony tail.  Also the manager of the restaurant / bar took the time to come check on us to see if we needed anything else from the bar and was always walking around to make sure that service and cleanliness were top notch.  Taxis  If you need a taxi, I suggest that you download the Uber app and register. Ubers cost about half as much as regular taxis.  Also, the hotel has a shuttle that will take you to nearby places if you just ask.  Pets  No pets are allowed.  Overall we enjoyed our stay.  We appreciate how the employees went out of their way to be friendly with us and we look forward to returning in the future.…","Responded Sep 15, 2018","Response from Edmee G, Gerente at Casa Grande ChihuahuaResponded Sep 15, 2018","Dear guest, thank you very much for your comments, the objective of all of us who work in the hotel is to achieve the full satisfaction of our guests, the feedback that makes us please to share allows us to work on our failures and try to be better, receive a best regads from all the hotel staff."

The staff was very friendly and check in was very easy.  The room is very small as expected, but certainly clean.  You only get one bath towel per person (no wash cloth or hand towel).  A recommendation to the hotel would be to provide a simple hand towel and/or washcloth as well so one can dry their hands after washing them.  The included breakfast was a buffet style and actually quite good.  The location of the hotel was also good, only about 2 miles or so from the historical center of town where most of the museums and tourist attractions are.  Overall, excellent value, especially if you are only staying a night or two.  Their check out time is quite late (1PM) which was very convenient for us as our flight wasn’t until the afternoon.

Location: You need to walk about 15-20 minutes to get downtown, which makes it not too convenient for a night walk, also because the neighborhood didn't feel safe after dark.  The room: it was a little bit small, but if it's good enough for a short stay.  There were no hand towels and no hooks to hang any towel. The heater didn't work, and we stayed in January, so it was a bit uncomfortable since the room was cold.  I don't know how it would be to stay there in the summer.

And also by the bed side shelf - needles to say it was awfully disgusting! We were there only one night so decided we can live with that. We checked out at 5am next morning to get to the chepe train, paid and left without the breakfast.  However few days later when I returned home and checked my account I noticed the hotel did already take money from my account (they took the details from the card that was used to book it on booking.com) a DAY BEFORE we even checked in!!! And then on a day of our check out they charged us again on a different credit card!  Since then I have been trying to call them numerous times to try get the money back, once they told me they charged us twice because in the system it looks like we stayed two nights! And they were not able to do anything despite the fact I sent them photos and copies of receipts etc. I sent another 4 emails with all details and no one got back to me (they promise 48h turnaround and it's been a week now). I sense they are playing dumb to just keep the money. I'm hoping maybe I'll get management attention this way here at least.  Stay somewhere else to avoid the disappointment.  …","Responded Apr 23, 2017","Response from Miguel O, Manager at ibis Chihuahua HotelResponded Apr 23, 2017",.
1325,"Everything you need! Good, modern clean room, economical, everything works and Dog Friendly!",4,1,2017,daddyogrande,"One would think dog friendly would be a given in a city called Chihuahua, but it's very difficult. There are others but this is the least expensive and he most modern one I've found. This was my third stay and the staff is always very friendly and the rooms are always nice. 200 peso charge for the dog (US$10), but even with that it's still the best price in town. Conveniently located next to an Oxxo and a bank in the same parking lot. The breakfast is fine, but there are better restaurants in Chihuahua for dinner. I have noticed that the room heat seems to have a limit on how high it will warm the room and on one visit it was extremely cold. If it wasn't for that, I would give it 5 stars instead of 4.","Responded Jan 23, 2017","Response from Ricardo U, General Manager at ibis Chihuahua HotelResponded Jan 23, 2017","Dear Guest,  Thank you for the great review of our hotel!

Complimentary breakfast in the morning, as well as open bar in the evening.   Unfortunatly, I worked during the time of the bar being open, so don't know if it was free, or cash-bar.  I kept one shirt and pair of jeans for my flights, and just left them on a chair as I usually do.. the first day, the housekeeper folded my jeans, and hung my shirt on the back of the chair, as well as wrapped up the cords to my cell-phone chargers!  In all my stay's, i've never had this kind of room service.  They did tend to forget that there was an American in the room, who knew no Spanish, but once I asked ""habla English?"" they were able to talk to me, and help me.  The only downside I can tell, even tho they have a shuttle van there, the van DOES NOT go to the airport.. however, there are always a couple of taxi's waiting curbside for them to flash a light and call them in.  I'm gonna say NO to airport transportation below, but only because you have to pay for the taxi, it's not a free shuttle ride.…","Responded Sep 13, 2018","Response from Cityexpress Chi...

1333,"Big room, no window, average breakfast ",3,2,2020,Hazel S,Stayed for 2 nights.  Best thing is the location - next to the cathedral.  The room was big with 2 double beds.  Clean.  Good shower and bathroom.  But window was onto an inner stair well. The breakfast - included in room rate - was in the bar.  Not allowed in the main restaurant for a much better buffet. Didn’t make sense. Poor coffee but good granola and muffins.  But we had to squeeze together in the small bar and had limited choice on the buffet.  Had dinner one night.  It was good and reasonably priced with friendly service.

1334,Because of the amazing staff it should be a 5 star hotel,4,11,2019,caper1961,"While I have stayed at many 4 and 5 star hotels it was usually wasted on me because I never really used the services of any staff, my interaction usually was limited to the check in staff and if they didn't make me fill out my name and address by hand then that was perfect.  My stay at this hotel changed my mind about how attentive and helpful  staff can greatly improve your experience.  Starting with the check in, My wife and I had been travelling for about 18 hours coming from Kelowna to Vancouver to Mexico city with a 7 hour wait from midnight till 7:00 am till we boarded the plane to Chihuahua.  So when we went to check in at 9:00 am we where a little groggy, the check in people new we were on the morning train so suggested that we go right away to the restaurant and get our free breakfast.  later that day they fixed us up with an english speaking cab and later that night when I asked for a cab to a certain restaurant, he asked what kind of food did we want and made a very good suggestion that was only walking distance from the hotel. Next day my wife left her brand new I phone under the pillow when we checked out, we did not discover it until we were at the train station, called the hotel and they checked the room and sent it over in a cab because there was not enough time to travel back and catch the train.…","Responded Nov 27, 2019","Response from jbarud, General Manager at Quality Inn ChihuahuaResponded Nov 27, 2019","Dear Guest,   Thank you for your recent stay at our property and for select us as your hotel in your trip to Chihuahua, your comments are important to us and help us to improve our service.

1343,Best Western Mirador with Vivabus hints,4,8,2015,submarinernm,"The rooms at the Best Western Mirador are very large and great for Families traveling in town or launching a trip to Creel and the Copper Canyon. I really like that the Hotel is located right on Universidad Avenue with ease access to a Vivabus Station. There are also two rent-a-car dealers right next to the hotel if you did not bring your car.  The hotel looks and feels just like the Best Westerns of the roadway from west Texas, New Mexico and Arizona in the USA. The large rooms open onto a central parking lot where you park just outside the room. The hotel has two stories, so we had a room on the second floor near the end. The kids loved the indoor hotel and their was lots of room to just sit down and relax.   The Hotel has a good restaurant and bar on property, which makes it great for staying on site.   Getting around:   A one way taxis run to downtown is about 3 dollars. Walking to downtown is about 3/4 of a mile and takes about 15 to 20 minutes. I uploaded a taxis rate sheet for the City from the hotel for your review.  While we were there, we took the local public transportation called 'Vivabus' from the Deza y Ulloa Station on Universidad Ave, just a block from the hotel. The cost is a onetime charge of 20 pesos for your bus card and 6 pesos or about 40 cents per person for each stop, no matter the length of route. Note: Buy one card and use it for the members of your group.   To use the Vivabus, look for the Red Stations in the middle of Universidad and pick up the bus in the direction you want to go. The Buses on the North/South route are new Mercedes Marco Polo, Air Conditioned ones which are very similar to those in the big Cities in the US. The main bus route goes North to South through the City, so if you wish to go downtown, take the South route which heads to the right of the Station. To return from downtown, take the North Route back to the Hotel.  There are several station stops in the Central Historic Area which will take you extremely close to specific restaurants, Museums and Plazas. Please note that the downtown loop of Vivabus is figure 8 with certain stops only available on the South or North Routes.   Here are important stops for your stay at the Best Western Mirador:  Hotel bus stop for either direction is Deza Y Ulloa.  These are the South Route stops from hotel :  Fuentes Danzarinas is the stop for the Templo de San Francisco de Asís, Casa Chihuahua, Palace of the Governors, 14 Coffees, the Hidalgo's Dungeon, Plaza de Angel, Grand Plaza of Chihuahua and the Chihuahua Barbaro - Day tours main ticket office.  Juarez Station is the stop for the Casa Juarez or the Museum of the Republic. Casa Siglo XIX is just two blocks from the Juarez station on the Right hand side of the street. Casa Siglo XIX is a wonderful art museum downtown with wonderful free public restrooms near the Cathedral.   The Sagrado Corazon Station will take you to the steps of the Sacred Heart Cathedral. If you walk up Avenue 20 de Noviembre two blocks to Calle 10a then take a right onto Calle 10a and walk two more blocks, you be at the entrance of the Pancho Villa Museum.    These are the North Route stops from the hotel :  The Quinta Gameros Station will take you right in front of the beautiful French Styled Quinta Gameros house completed in 1910. This is a one of the most beautiful homes in all of Mexico and is a must stop for those who love architecture.  The Catedral Station is on the under pass directly below the Catedral de Chihuahua and its great plaza. Once you get off the bus, just walk up two flights of stairs and you are right next to the Cathedral. This is also the stop for the Quality Inn where the Chihuahua Barbaro tour bus departs 4 times a day. This is also a great stop to return to the hotel after your trip downtown.  The Sor Juana Station, traveling north from the hotel, will take you to an Alsuper grocery store which will provide you all your food and convenience items needs on the trip. An Alsuper is very similar to the neighborhood Wal-Mart stores open in the US. The Alsuper has a great café for a quick affordable lunch and dinner as will as good prices on beer and wine for the room. They have weekly beer special and I was able to buy German Beck's and Sam Adams Cherry Wheat beer for 6 pesos a bottle during our stay. When finished shopping, take the south bus route back to the Hotel.   VIVABUS Instructions :  To ride the bus, you will need to use the Red Ticket machines in the Station to buy and charge your bus card. If you select the American Flag on the machine's screen, the instructions will switch to English for easy use. The Bus Cards will cost a one-time charge of 20 pesos. Next place the card in the slot and recharge the card with Mexican coins or bills. Remember to press the green checkmark after you enter your money and leave the card in place until the money has been deposited to the card. There is a little white card reader on a pole at the front of most stations which will let you check your balance.

1356,You tell me what you think,1,6,2022,Mariana S,"Our stay was not pleasant at all. We got a room on the fifth floor. OMG, we couldn't sleep with the noise on the roof all night. And early in the morning, the birds picking on the roof won't let you catch on your sleep for the night before.  I had to ask to get the room clean two days in a row and only the first day was cleaned. The second time I asked, I was told someone was coming to clean and nobody came. So the room did not get clean at all.  The shower flooded and the water would come out of the shower area onto the toilet floor. I didn't even bother to report it. All I did was to throw towels on the floor to get the floor dried.   At the pool bar, I wasn't allowed to vape, even though the pool bar is out doors (!!!). I was told ""that's because of the children."" However, there's a sign on the pool bar that no children are allowed!!! and the children's pool is about 250 feet away (!!!!).  And to top it up, at the snack bar, there is a sign with the food they sell. I ordered 6 shrimp tacos (2 tacos for $110) and I was charged $640 instead of $330. I asked for the difference and I was told ""that's because you don't have credit in your account"" (???). When I checked out, I asked again for that charge and I was told the same thing. I asked the receptionist to explain and he said ""because you don't have credit, I can't see the charges on your room"" (??!!!!). The explanation did not make sense at all!!!  This was the second and final time we stay at this place.…",Responded 1 week ago,"Response from Mario Alberto Castillo, Other at Penasco Del Sol HotelResponded 1 week ago","Dear Mariana.  We appreciate your comments regarding your recent stay at PEÑASCO DEL SOL HOTEL.  For us it is very important to know the opinion of our guests.   We have learned that you had inconveniences to enjoy your stay with us, for which we approach you to offer our sincere apology.   There is not much we can do about the birds, since they are part of the Puerto Peñasco ecosystem.  We have reviewed the reports from our maids as well as the housekeeping coordinators and we have noticed that both days you mentioned the do not disturb card was on your door, so it is very important for us to respect the privacy of our guests, that is why the cleaning was not done.  Regarding the shower, you should have reported the situation as soon as it happened, because through the comments of our guests, we can work on our areas of opportunity.  Regarding the vape, since last week in Mexico by presidential decree, the use of these items is prohibited in the country, which is why we have prohibited the entry and consumption of this item.  Regarding the issue of credit, at the time of check in at any hotel internationally, a retention is requested either in credit card or cash so you can charge any consumption directly to the room and at check out to close the outstanding balance. According to what we reviewed in your consumption ticket, the payment was 330 pesos equivalent to the 6 tacos you mentioned, plus 15% service charge.  Anyway, we appreciate your visit and your comments.   It will be a pleasure for us to welcome you again.  Thank you in advance and we are here to serve you.  "

1362,Fantastic Experience,5,3,2022,Shaleen M,"This was my first trip to Mexico and it was really an icredible trip, and a great learning experience.   Pros: The hotel is in a great spot right on the beach with direct access. Literally five steps and you're there. The beach itself is incredible. The tides go way in and out - you can explore tidepools, or swim.   The pool and hot tub were spacious and thebperfect temperature, and we never had trouble finding an open chair. We wandered out to the hot tub a half hour before it closed on our first night, and they turned the jets back on for us and came right out to offer drinks and towels.   The on-site restaurant was delicious, had great dinner and great breakfast options - we had Yasmine as our waitress on our first and last day and she was so friendly and helpful.   The poolside service was also great - fun snacks and very inexpensive drinks. We had a number of servers, and Javier stood out as especially attentive and helpful. There are also a lot of restaurants very close to the hotel that were great.   The rooms were pretty standard hotel rooms, but they were probably the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept on, with quality comforters and pillows. The room we were in had an INCREDIBLE view of the beach.   Cons:  The resort was undergoing some renovations while we were there. It wasn't really a big deal, but the louder construction noises were a little annoying when relaxing by the pool. However, they only worked during specific hours and not all day.   While the food was great, there really weren't a lot of Mexican options on the menu. It was mostly American fare with a few Mexican dishes - I would have preferred more local foods.   Additionally, we really struggled finding vegetarian options. One person I traveled with is a vegetarian, and there were maybe one or two dishes at any restaurant without meat if we were lucky. They even tried ordering a salad with no meat listed on the menu, and it ended up coming out with bacon on it. 😂 If you are going to order something and request it without meat, be specific and I recommend you order in Spanish for clarity.   Puerto Peñasco is lovely. We found the locals to be very friendly, and there are some great restaurants and shops. However, the drive from the border (we crossed at Sonoyta down from Tucson) is a bit desolate - pretty much zero services until you reach Peñasco - and the city itself is a liiiittle rough. You will want to be mindful of where you go if you step away from the touristy areas, but I understand that this is pretty par for the course for Mexico vacationers, or anyone who vacations in a new city.   Overall: We had an absolutely wonderful time. The staff were friendly and helpful, the food was great, the room was just fine, and the beach was gorgeous. We can't wait to go back!…","Responded Mar 10, 2022","Response from Mario Alberto Castillo, Other at Penasco Del Sol HotelResponded Mar 10, 2022","Dear Shaleen  We appreciate your comments regarding your recent stay at PEÑASCO DEL SOL HOTEL.

1364,Pleasant room. Visit for creative breakfast buffet!,5,3,2022,An0nyMs,"My room was standard Ibis: minimal and clean, but also bigger than some. (Go elsewhere for more charm or local flavor.) The location is boring (government buildings, a big hospital, etc.) but it's also just a 15-minute walk to the cathedral, etc. There's an OXXO two blocks away by the river where you can buy six liters of Bonafont drinking water for 29 pesos.  If you're staying somewhere else, check out the breakfast buffet here for 159 pesos. (The San Sebastian buffet is probably much larger but also costs 250 pesos... maybe go there if you're starved?) I love creative food, and this breakfast buffet was -- on weekdays, at least. (I don't know if weekends are different if the chef isn't here). No typical US-type buffet of scrambled eggs and waffles here. For instance, this morning the two standouts were grilled ham in onions, green peppers and tomatoes, and chiles rellenos.. The server offered me hot tortillas (flour or corn) off the grill. There were four kinds of fruit juice and three kinds of fresh fruit, cold cereal and yogurt, as well as the usual quesadillas and soupy beans.

The rooms are no frills and are small and very basic.   The shower presented loads of problems as it took me longer than average to get clean as it sprayed everywhere else, but where I needed it.

The employees are very service minded, they speak English, and are courteous and cheerful.      The breakfast is crazy good especially compared to the crap that you find in the US. No lining up for the messy waffle iron. There is a very large spread of juices, hot drinks, fruits, hot eggs, beans, breads, and much more.

1372,Insane amount of noise from bar next door prevents sleep,1,4,2019,PSA,"We have no trouble with the Ibis budget concept - we stayed in the Ibis recently in Culiacan and it was quite good.  But in Hermosillo they failed to tell us that there was a bar directly outside our window which started with ear shatteringly loud music at 9:30 pm which lasted until 3am.   I'm sorry - but when your hotel is next to a Mexican bar that's as loud as a rock concert, you should care enough about your guests to mention it.  It wasn't what we needed after a 12 hour drive.  We could have been given a room on the opposing side of the hotel, or, better yet, we could have easily found a different hotel.  When I approached the manager in the morning, they would not even give me a discount, which still wouldn't have compensated for the lack of sleep.  This hotel, compared to the relatively new Ibis in Culiacan, is not particularly clean or in good repair.  Don't expect any extras at all, even hand or face cloths.  But when you can't sleep at a hotel, and the management isn't good enough to explain this prior to check-in, then it ceases to function as a place to sleep and merits a terrible review.…","Responded Apr 8, 2019","Response from IsraelGzz, General Manager at Hotel Ibis HermosilloResponded Apr 8, 2019","Dear Guest,   Thank you in advance for your comments, it is always good to receive feedback about our service.

1382,Rundown property,2,11,2021,Jay M,"Hotel is a perfect example of a business that builds up its name brand then rides the wave letting things go downhill without fixing them. My second stay of 7+ days WI-Fi terrible suspect they on have a few access points and minimal bandwidth. Several times during my stay gmail wouldn’t open unless I went with low bandwidth option.  Sometimes it was after 2am (I work evenings)  Air conditioner doesn’t cool but keeps running (noisy).   Food in hotel is extremely expensive, I travel a lot so I am aware it usually is but this one more than most.    They advertise they’re on of Mexico’s best, comparable to a low end Motel 6 or Super 8 in USA.    It’s sad owners won’t invest a little bit of money to get this place back like it was when it opened.

This is a family owned resort and is not like the huge condos or resorts you see on the beach. Israel and his family were wonderful hosts and made us feel right at home.  The rooms are clean and comfortable and they have a nice little continental breakfast in their breakfast area that is included the price of your stay.  The best part is that it is just north of the Malecon area and easily walkable to all the bars, restaurants and shopping, but far enough away that you don't hear the noise at night. It's also not a far drive from the beach at Los Conchas.  We will definitely stay there again and I would encourage anyone who is looking for a nice, inexpensive place to stay to consider it, you won't be disappointed.…","Responded Nov 12, 2018","Response from Guadalupe A, Owner at Hospedaje MulegeResponded Nov 12, 2018",We are happy to hear that you had a great time and hope to see you sometime soon.

1410,Excellent sights and quiet environment,4,1,2018,Nicolas_PHermosillo,"The building is historic. It sort of Spanish-Andalucian hacienda with red-tile roofs and white walls. It's almost one-hundred years old. It was built in the 1920s by the Southern Pacific Railroad Co. However, the place is in good shape and the service was good. The rooms are nice and with enough space. Some of the rooms have an excellent view of the Bacochibampo bay with the Teta Cahui mountain in the horizon. The saguaro garden is also a good walk with some benches to rest and see the sights. The restaurant and bar service is fine. In the bar you may admire the hewn-wood art work of Dick Wicken that portrays scenes of the Hernan Cortés conquest of Mexico and his deals with the local Indian women.

1411,"Take off that mirror, please!",4,1,2020,RicherTrips,"Have you stayed with us since our renovation?"", asked the gentleman at the front desk. My husband had, but not me, so I payed close attention to the improvements. The lobby, restaurant, bar and business center looked the same.   When we came out of the elevator at our floor, I sensed the classic smell of new carpets. I didn’t like much the spotted pattern, because the installers didn’t take the time to match the patches. In the bedroom, I noticed a new wood-like floor with a rug, a nice padded bedhead, a new modern armchair, no longer with footrest. Hanging and accent lamps replace the night tables lamps.   There are new drape curtains and a blackout electrical curtain that comes out of its rail easily; in that case, turn it up and down several times, until in falls in the rail again. The switch is on the night table closer to the window, on the bed side.  A new lighted mirror in the bedroom looked beautiful during the day, but at night it became a nightmare. It has a stand-by glowing blue light, the kind of light than can be seen with your eyes closed. I tried to dim it,  turn it off or disconnect it, but the mirror was built in the wall. I had to buy black cardboard and tape to cover it because it was really annoying.  The new TV is a smart one, so you can open your streaming accounts. There´s still no mini bar and now the coffee pot is gone. I wonder why... .That´s why the first night, we ordered refreshments from room service. Oddly, the attendant asked for our payment method. ""Charge it to the room"" I said. ""I have to ask if that is possible"", she replied, and put me on hold for 4 or 5 minutes. She finally complied.…","Responded Jan 14, 2020","Response from ADOLFO S, Gerente at Hotel Lucerna HermosilloResponded Jan 14, 2020","Dear Guest,   Thank you for letting us your comments, we are working hard to make improvements in this your hotel.

1417,Fell & Got Injured On Trays Placed In Lobby,1,11,2020,Kiloh S,"On November 6th, 2020, my wife and I drove from Phoenix, Arizona, to the Holiday Inn Express in Guaymas, Mexico, for a vacation until November 9th. Upon entering the hotel, we noticed two black plastic trays in the middle of the lobby floor. There were no explanation signs, or warning signs, and we stepped around them.  The next day, returning to the hotel after a day at the beach, I tripped over one of the trays and fell.... hard., I was unable to get up off the floor and had to be assisted to a chair to recover. I was not seriously injured but I was shaken up badly and spent the rest of the evening in bed. I COULD have been seriously injured.  The next day, I called the Corporate Office to alert them of this negligent injury hazard. I was given a Case Number. Nobody from the Corporate Office has called me back and it is now Tuesday, November 7th.  My whole point in calling them was to alert them of this dangerous practice being done by the Holiday Inn Express in Guaymas. Instead, I get the feeling that both the Corporate Office and the facility in Guaymas wish to deny responsibility. The Corporate Office doesn't contact me and the facility claims to not speak English.  I have posted images of the trays in the floor. You be the judge about whether this is safe. The next guy to fall might get seriously hurt. Disappointed in the Corporate Office and the facility in Guaymas.…","Responded Dec 1, 2020","Response from IHG Service, Owner at Holiday Inn Express GuaymasResponded Dec 1, 2020","Hi kilohs,  Thank you for staying with us.

When we mentioned it their response was “oh it’s because sometimes they have groups .....and then said nothing more. What kind of groups? Eeeewww that was gross. The remote control had no batteries we had to call for an iron. It was bad. We called the front desk they changed us to another room which was a bit better. At the least it did t smell and was too dirty. I think the starts it has are way off. I spoke to I e if the employees and they said they are the same owners as Fiesta Americana across the street and they put everything into that hotel and this one was just bought out to avoid the competition but it’s not cared for. When on the elevator we made small talk with a guest just to learn military live there. Soooo it’s more like a motel. Here is a video to back up what I’m saying.

1442,Huge disappointment,1,12,2018,Alix S,"We were greeted nicely at the front desk in the very pleasant and comfortable entry area. We were pleased to find a clean room with a comfortable bed. Every part of our experience after that was dismal.   The ""restaurant"" was nothing like what we expected, and there were no others within safe walking distance. We skipped both dinner and breakfast because the space was so dreary and they only served cruddy fast food. I got the one and only beer in the whole place and took it back to share with my husband while we watched a movie on my computer; there was only one English-speaking channel on the hotel TV, and we did not want to watch Fox News. I had a sprinkle cookie wrapped in plastic washed down with my nearly undrinkable coffee with powder creamer, rather than sit in that depressing space and risk eating what looked unpalatable.  There was a private party that evening in one of the hotel's big spaces, upstairs from the lobby, away from the hotel rooms. Unfortunately, many of the guests decided to party in large groups in their rooms (on either side of ours and down the hallway), including on the balcony walkway in front of our door. We finally called the front desk at 2:30 a.m. to complain, and Security got them to settle down by 3.   In every other hotel I've stayed in in Mexico, there is a part of the contract, signed at check-in, agreeing to specific rules of conduct. It's unfortunate that these people felt as though they owned the place, and downright maddening that the hotel did not monitor the situation at all. There were huge areas of the hotel with no guests at all, or with families traveling with children, where we would have been better placed from the beginning.  I thought about showering again in the morning, but the water from the previous night had still not drained.   This was the last night of our 2-month vacation in Mexico.

The reception area leads you to believe you are at a pretty nice place. Once you get to the room, things change in a hurry. Our room overlooked a ball field. Luckily the AC drowned out the noise. The carpet was in need of repair - wore my flip flops everywhere. Beds were pretty firm...I think the floor would have been squishier. There was some type of voodoo art on the wall next to the beds...probably would have been a ritual performed had any of us been virgins. Bathroom faucet had two laser beams for water streams.

1448,Pet friendly? Not so much... ,2,5,2017,Effie B,"I was traveling through from Sayulita, Nayarit to Nogales,Arizona and needed a place to stay in Hermosillo. I was travelling with my two dogs. Finding places that are pet friendly is always a challenge. The Hotel Colonial in Hermosillo says they are pet friendly on their website. I went ahead and made a booking through their booking site. I wrote on my reservation request that I had "" two well behaved dogs "". Upon checking in, I asked the clerk if she spoke English. She said no. My Spanish is very poor so we did not converse much. As soon as I was settled in my room, I took the dogs for a long overdue walk. Upon returning to my room, my key no longer worked on the door. A customer service agent came to see me and explained that I had not let them know that I had dogs. I brought up my email and she said that I hadn't been charged for having pets. She left to the front desk to confer with colleagues and returned with my booking reservation with my request regarding the dogs. She said that the two dogs would be $700 pesos ( the cost of the room itself) . I paid the extra pesos as I was in need of the room. The front desk person I dealt with was Lupita. She was very professional and I have no issue with this. I felt that perhaps they should have read the reservation I had made online before locking me out of the room. The room itself was adequate but worn. It did leave a bad taste for me and I doubt I will return. …","Responded May 24, 2017","Response from Faustino G, Gerente at Hotel ColonialResponded May 24, 2017","Dear Effie B, as the website says, we are pet friendly, however , in the room just could stay one dog. this is policy is for comfort reasons of our other guests as well as yours.

In the extensive traveling that I have done, never have I had a hotel room with nothing but a well-worn sheet....there was no blanket other than the bedspread, that I would question whether it was washed between guests.
